"As someone who was born and raised in Qatar, AND has literally been to the industrial area on foot. I can confirm that most of this is quite common knowledge. Most people are aware of the fact that these labour workers or labourers are treated quite harshly with abysmal working conditions. The footage you've collected is quite accurate and it's impossible not to notice living there. Every where you go, you could see them working on the side of the road and on buildings wearing the uniforms even in the heat. There are a lot of parts of the city, especially industrial area where you have huge labour camps. But the thing is, it's so normalisied that it doesn't really stand out or seen as that big of a problem. It's sort of just accepted. This is the case for most gulf countries, where you have a huge portion of the labour class essentially just segregated, and the kafala system is a rapant problem and a huge human rights issue across the region. Qatar has a huge immigrant population, mainly to reach it's 2030 goal and vision for the future. Seeing as most of the infrastructure for those projects have already been completed, it's a bit too late. The damage has been done. The fact that Qatar is an incredibly rich country and could've easily paid these workers fair wages yet they chose to actively exploit them for as cheap as possible baffles me.",2022-11-27T18:36:16Z,0

"Hey Johnny,

Your reporting is very accurate, yet still disingenuous. You must say that this happens in all of the GCC countries all together and not a special case for Qatar: Saudi Arabia, Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, even in some other places near them also have the same state of affairs for tens of years ever since discovering hydrocarbons there. You must also say that the construction business, specifically, is ones of the most lethal jobs world wide, not only in that place, but in many other places in Africa, Asia, South America, even the US and Canada for undocumented immigrants and people in need for ""any job they can have"". You must also say that those construction contractors are European and American companies and they are after maximizing their profits, just like the Qataris. Here in Quebec, we were told in an official training that ""we more people in Quebec's construction than any other profession here!"" and that is Quebec in Canada of North America!

I would even take it a step further, those workers coming from humble backgrounds are already suffering poverty and harsh life conditions at their own country and their governments: their live conditions are directly influenced by negligence and corruption there. When many go to the very harsh and unspeakable working condition at the GCC countries, and this deeply disheartens me, are at an UPGRADE of their original lifestyles! Hands down they are not treated good. Hands down they deserve to be treated better. But if the World Cup thing has done nothing but to force the laws in those places to change for the better, then it is a HUGE human value already.

I have worked, firsthand, under the Kafala system; to be completely overlooked by a local sponsor. It is a very unjust system and needs reform, the least to say, if not abolished at all. But I have also seen how it is becoming looser and looser and how it is getting re-organized to better benefit the workers. I hope to see it dissolve altogether with no coming back.

Wanna a scoop? OK. See those workers protests ""quashed"" by the Qatari police? I have a firsthand account from an eye witness who said that the reinforcements to the police came from the American military base there; Al Udeid Air Base. Have a good night sleep Johnny!

"As someone who was born and raised in Qatar, AND has literally been to the industrial area on foot. I can confirm that most of this is quite common knowledge. Most people are aware of the fact that these labour workers or labourers are treated quite harshly with abysmal working conditions. The footage you've collected is quite accurate and it's impossible not to notice living there. Every where you go, you could see them working on the side of the road and on buildings wearing the uniforms even in the heat. There are a lot of parts of the city, especially industrial area where you have huge labour camps. But the thing is, it's so normalisied that it doesn't really stand out or seen as that big of a problem. It's sort of just accepted. This is the case for most gulf countries, where you have a huge portion of the labour class essentially just segregated, and the kafala system is a rapant problem and a huge human rights issue across the region. Qatar has a huge immigrant population, mainly to reach it's 2030 goal and vision for the future. Seeing as most of the infrastructure for those projects have already been completed, it's a bit too late. The damage has been done. The fact that Qatar is an incredibly rich country and could've easily paid these workers fair wages yet they chose to actively exploit them for as cheap as possible baffles me. 

I really like how you've covered this topic, it's quite well done and I appreciate the effort to try and a hands on view of the whole situation. This is one of the more objective stories I've seen on this issue. Much thanks.",2022-11-27T14:40:41Z,5
"@Jo-Ann Morency Vice just did a doc on this modern day slavery too. There is no specific place I know of ,but People from other countries  that are looking for so called better opportunities are trafficked into the US all over in hopes of making a better life for a fee. Often this fee charged by these traffickers entails complete control of every aspect of this person seeking asylum or whatever. There forced to work in horrid conditions for near nothing for employers who are in connection with these traffickers or the trafficker runs the biz. Theres more to it but its true. Then obviously sex workers are often made slaves to there pimps etc . There's many more situations of modern day slavery and it probably happens everywhere sadly.

This place mostly were rented by cheapskate contractor who are taking subcontracting work. (please look for Workers Accommodation Camp - Labour City - This is new building that made for migrant workers to settle in and most company who work in major construction rented this)

If you want to be fair go and search for those expatriates who are currently living and working in qatar or even dubai and getting thousands of dollars in a month!!!!! In fact most of foreigners are getting more than nationals for the same job simply because our country values international experience and takes into consideration that these foreigners are leaving everything behind and because of this our country pays them everything from A to Z starting from their tickets, on boarding of boarding expenses, accommodations and other major allowances!!! Yes these people are working hard and in our country we are paying them a fair and competitive salary and we do protect their rights. Go and google on country’s labor laws before spreading hate and fake facts!

"I lost interest in WC when they built the Brazilian one bc the worker conditions were shared globally. You'd think things would change. Also the middle east has always been like this, the WC is no exception. It hurts to see my countrymen being treated like this by Muslims who are supposed to have a high standard of treatment. People kill and marry and enslave themselves into debt to get to the middle east to work because of the opportunity to climb out of poverty... for generations to come - theoretically. Families back home do not realize how difficult, humiliating, and dehumanizing the circumstances are. If they did, they'd be happy with their mud homes and fresh air in the country where you can try and make a living from the land. 

I won't touch how corrupt the Bangladeshi govt is and how difficult it has become to even survive on the tropical lush land that can sustain gardening and agriculture so easily.

I was in Dubai a few years ago. The foreign workers there who helped build say the Burj Khalifa…they were bused an hour and half to an area with horrible living conditions.

Being behind a screen with dramatic music isn’t what I thought this channel was about… in any case, thank you for trying. It was motivated by a good cause. 

Just a tip. Weird zoning is due to the country not actually having street names or building numbers until 2015 or so, and labor camps exist also in Alkhor, Wakra, Dukhan, and so many more areas. The industrial area just has more industrial shops. The metro lines didn’t reach any of the outskirts of Doha due to shortage of time, not because they were intentionally cutting industrial area off.

World Cup construction stadiums were handled by French, Chinese, Turkish, and Italian companies who were contracted to do this. governments don’t send people to recruit, there aren’t enough Qataris to do this job, there were recruitment agencies to recruit labor for this. Yes Qatar with its lack of laws to protect the rights of those workers is at fault, but if this is about human rights, the main perpetrators should at least get an honorable mention. 

Lastly, just an FYI, Qataris don’t get an allowance for just being Qatari, and the older generations did do a lot of these hard labor jobs. My paternal grandfather was Qatari, he was a working in one of those low paying jobs, and he died on duty.",2022-11-26T06:43:03Z,0

While the West is simultaneously shooting refugees in the Mediterranean and locking them up in cages throughout Europe? Why doesn’t he go over to the refugee camps in Europe and see how they are treated there?

Oh wait, thats right. Its because no one would ever allow him to record or even speak to any of these refugees to tell their side of the story.

Its very easy to lecture others how to live",2022-11-25T11:52:50Z,0

"Not want to protect qatar, But most fault is from the agency where the worker came, they give you false promises and ask you some money to get the jobs, after they send you to other country they will take your visa and other documents to make sure you stay there, The agency not from qatar but from the worker country, And they not only send to qatar, Mostly they send you to ""rich country"" like Qatar, Dubai, Singapore, Etc, I know because im from Indonesia and its happen to my relatives that works on Singapore

"Ok, I'll put it as short as I can but feel free to comment on this. I'm an educated journalist and PR pro, I work at the university teaching journalist, PR and media students. I admire what Johnny has been doing. I agree journalism should be free and with no strings attached to report on what is really going on around us. However, it seems to me Johnny is becoming more and more personal about every single issue he is covering. It is called a personal bias, guilding the lily so to say. I get it: personal insight is an engaging thing for all us viewers but his approach is becoming less and less different from the strings the news corporations and their sponsors or politics attach to them. Less personal attachment and more balance may only contribute to the fairness of the coverage. And more of his material (especially the latest one about FIFA) is becoming chaotic, poorer in research and background story etc. Sorry to say that but try not moving forward in the current direction and get less sit-of-the pants view in favour of a more balanced and truthful coverage with less emotional approach. Stick to information and abandon commentary as much as you can. Please consider it because your golden and I love your coverage I'm sure we need you. Do your job but engage personally a bit less.

"It’s true that working conditions of labours are not good in Middle Eastern countries. And the authorities must act on it and treat labours with much way. And we seen Qatar has worked on it and improved the situation and more need to be done. But question is why only Qatar and not other neighbouring countries with similar situation or worse. is that  just because they good relation with other countries? And now question is does western countries have moral authority to criticise Qatar or other countries? As we can see most of the labours are from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Why people of these countries migrate to gulf countries despite knowing such situations? It’s because, at least they earn here better than their own country and the able to support their family and build foundation of their family for future growth. And now question is why only Middle Eastern countries and not western countries? It’s simple because western countries don’t entertain these labours at all, forget about employment, they don’t even give them tourist visa easily if they ever think to apply. So now tell me who is bigger criminal here? The one who close the doors, so you cannot enter or the one who permits you to enter with some hardship and fulfil your needs and let you to dream again. 

I’m not justifying the hardship of labours and not supporting the treatment of gulf countries but questioning the hypocrisy of west.

"Johnny, if you are all concerned about the immigrant workers in Qatar, why don't you lobby for them to come the US, or wherever you live. So you know those immigrant workers were coming to Qatar for decades, what prompted you to start your investigation now. You and the leftist whom are crying about the why can't  we fly the LGBTQ flag. That is not YOUR COUNTRY and YOU HAVE NO FREAKING BUSINESS ON WHAT THEY DO.",2022-11-24T22:01:54Z,1

"Hilarious how we're getting morality lessons from a white westerner who's forgotten how blood is on their hand for colonizing most of the world. Get your white men's superiority complex out of here. Your Hypocrisy becomes clear when many of these ""labor Issues"" are problems western nations also go through, setting up companies in third-world countries in order to exploit the workers. I know it hurts your ego that an Arab nation is rising up after western colonization, but we shall rise and we shall succeed, and our values and norms will not be compromised due to western ideals of Liberalism.",2022-11-24T21:50:31Z,2

You have no actual argument. And we know by ""western ideals of Liberalism"" you mean basic human rights for lgbtq people and minorities, but guess what? no amount of crying, genocide, or violations, will prevent the existance of lgbtq people in arab countries.

"Paid to get a job, Passport taken away, can’t switch jobs, labor camps - Habibi, welcome to Dubai. 

This exploitation is fairly common in Dubai. There were also complaints but I doubt much has changed. These Middle Eastern countries were built on modern day slavery. 

I used to work for a huge MNC in Dubai that had a contractor issue “outsourced visa” to some employees. So these outsourcing companies even take passports of white collar employees in customer service, operations etc. basically anything that’s not of high importance or higher management get an outsourced visa instead of 1st party (MNC sponsoring them). And the companies that issue these visas are notorious for being assholes. 

Unfortunately despite so much coverage on this issue in Qatar there are so many folks going to watch the football matches there. Post the World Cup - it’s gonna be business as usual. How do we stop this slavery in UAE and Qatar ?

There is ""help"" for Nepali people in Qatar by Nepalese people who are showering in corruption money too. Nepal is highly dependent on the remittance that comes from these countries. It's the backbone of our economy. Women are exploited as sex slaves too. 3-4 bodies come back to our country every SINGLE day claiming death from ""natural"" causes. There is no humanity, only the deal with the devil. My parents have been so outspoken about this and Nepal is trying to make changes regarding all these issues but there are so many changes that need to be made. My heart breaks for all these people. Nepali wives and children here aren't happy either. It's all a game of debt and slavery disguised as foreign employment. This is truly disgusting. People sleep under the fans since it's so hot and they could actually bang their heads against it since the rooms are so packed. Men are so deprived of love and care, women are too. Extramarital affairs are just assumed by Nepali people here. I'm blessed to be a Nepali but for some people, it's a curse.

on the question no one ever said anything ;mainly because they had spent so much in coming  to Arab countries that they could just not afford going back, they needed the money however little they made.having said this,there is another side to the story too.there were employment companies which kept their employees(laborers mostly) in  proper conditions and paid them properly.
onthore aspect that id like to shine on is the construction companies and recruitment agencies.they too play and important role in this trap.sometimes ,at least in Saudi Arabia.the govt provided these agencies money to build proper accommodation and other stuff.but instead of using the whole amount for this things ,they kept most of it for themselves and provided poor quality stuff to the workers.i know this because  an Indo/pak.bagladeshi construction  was caught doing that in many of their project sites.it is bad what is happening but it is the need of that person that he endures all of this.",2022-11-24T14:51:12Z,0

Its the same situation out there. He was even nervous to go out to the mall. My roomate and i took him out to eat at a restaurant it was just 👀 on him. Our waiter went up to him and asked him a couple questions in Bengali. It wasnt about food since we were already eating. I asked him if hes good, somewhat nervous he replied yes all good.
We took him to the mall we all got new sneakers and clothes. End of the day my room mate and i surprised him and gifted him the clothes and sneakers. He was in tears. 
I miss him and havent heard from him i hope hes okay.",2022-11-24T13:00:29Z,0

When a job is offered, the workers know the salary expectation and conditions. They don't know that their passports will be taken away and they need an exit visa. Anyway, It's not the Qatar government directly doing this. It's a bunch of shark companies and agents who do this. For instance. The Experts who design the stadiums and conduct feasibility studies are also foreign. They live a good life and enjoy it. Once the construction tender is issued, companies Bid and by so doing, the lowest bidder with the right technical qualifications wins. These companies then go and source cheap labour to complete the won bids. These construction companies go on overdrive to squeeze the workers to make profits.

"Apparently this is just the tip of the iceberg.

There is a mantra that works in the vast majority of investigations of this type

follow the money, follow the money, follow the money...

Who are the construction companies that carry out all the works to adapt the host city of the World Cup within the standards defined by FIFA?

What political manifestations took place during these works, what were their agendas and claims?

What laws were passed within the host country that harm the poorest and those with less power and prestige within a society and who gains more power, money, prestige and recognition from these decisions?

Look what happened in the last cups.

Look at corruption allegations

See the story.
Does it repeat? What patterns exist and repeat?

In the Brazil Cup for example:

How did the government try to hide poverty and the undesirables from the eyes of the world?

Which groups were persecuted?

What were the demonstrations and who were the demonstrators, their agendas and demands?

What was voted in congress during this World Cup period that the big newspapers didn't report?

What were the allegations of corruption that were investigated?

Which corruption schemes will we never know because we don't have the information we need to know what to look for?

Which ""winners"" became ""losers"" during power struggles during this event and shortly thereafter?

Politicians, businessmen, workers, institutions?

What can these people tell you about the corruption schemes they were expelled from?

Who or what people were scapegoated in the investigations?

Are they alive?

Can they give interviews?

It's really hard what's going on.

What we can see are just the symptoms of a reaction to an action, just like it happens in the ill  human body.

People working under these conditions are the weakest link, they are the exploited and oppressed.

Who are the rich and oppressors?

What are their interests?

Which status quo modes are maintained?

And what is discarded and transformed during disputes?

Who wins what?

Money, prestige and most of all power...

Who are the victors who come out of these disputed arenas with more power, money and prestige?

Who are the losers?

What can they tell us? Can they talk?
If they can't, why can't they?

Look at FIFA itself.
What corruption schemes and allegations were instigated around the world?

What were the results of these investigations?

What investigations came to nothing?

Who were the people with the power to embargo and hinder these investigations?

Who wins what?

Who loses what?

Who can speak?
Who can't?

Who can manifest?
And who can't?

What is allowed?
What is not allowed?

When China had the olympics they were torturing thousands of muslims in concentration camps, killing them, and raping their women, forcing them to work in factories.

Muslims in India are killed, raped, burned alive everyday yet the world is silenced, and dont see that as human right violations.

"What's sadder is that when you're a family member of a migrant worker from the Gulf region, you're told that these ridiculous working conditions are normal. You're forced to be desensitized by your own government, recruiting agencies, and your own family for the sake of getting money in. My clan has a long history of being a migrant worker in various countries all over the globe, which is a norm from where I'm from, and we're told from a young age that the Gulf region is where the big bucks are. They also told me stories of their own experiences and how those things shouldn't deter us from working there. My uncles would tell stories about getting slapped in the face in front of his colleagues for simple things, just because of their ethnicity. My aunts would tell stories about being in so much debt because she maxed out her cards in order to send money to her family because her employers refused to give her salary. But this was from the mid-90s to late 2000s

We, from the younger generation, kept asking them why they kept working those conditions and they said that they needed to shut up and endure it, otherwise we wouldn't be able to ""enjoy"" a comfortable life. Ten years later, we're still not as comfortable as what they're saying.",2022-11-24T02:10:50Z,0

"I grew up in Bangladesh and I'm a software developer in the US now but as a kid, I used to hear from my parents about this issue, how the poor people from villages got trapped into this modern day slavery. All the skyscrapers you see are built by Filipino, African, Indian, Bangladeshi slaves. One of Indian friend's dad was an engineer there and they're considered 2nd class citizens. They have more rights than the slave class but they're still seen as ""inferior"". I've heard from him how his dad disagreed with one of the Emiratis once and he got spit on. Keep in mind, he was an engineer and not a labor which makes you wonder what would happen to lower class worker. I really wanted Johnny to cover this subject because of the reach his audience gets and his production quality. I've been researching this issue for a while now and I'll quote one of my comments I left along with some replies in another YouTube video months ago.

The video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJuqe6sre2I&lc=Ugw7Wxoh1BcQhlYfMaN4AaABAg.9eMBoryLl169ifmKtslyFG

My comment: 
As an Bangladeshi living in the US, thanks for shedding some light on it. It's fascinating how they use the term for westerners and how the labor class get treated live slaves. You're either a millionaire or a slave, no in between. The disparity between rich and poor is huge and they don't socially interact, very much the classic definition  of segregation.

Responses:

Username: Mr.Handsome 
I don't understand, how is US any different from dubai?

Username: Akshat Gupta
@Mr.Handsome  people who are paid less? Men from south asian countries are lured by these private construction companies to come and work in Dubai then their passports are seized and they are basically stuck in Dubai and made to sign contracts. They live in horrible conditions and are forced to work in extremely harmful conditions and these migrant workers are a decent chunk of the population. 90% of people in Dubai are migrants some are millionaires and some people like these which are coming to Dubai in hopes of a better life only to get stuck and be treated like objects.

Username: Not Tellingyou
Mr.Handsome no we aren’t talking about low paid workers.... we are talking about people who are taken from overseas, have their passports confiscated, and then are not paid even 50% of what they were promised (often getting paid NOTHING AT ALL) and then they are worked to death while their family back home - thousands of miles away in another country - starve. Because they can’t send money back if they aren’t getting it. And the worst part is they usually only get to go back in a wooden box :( there are lots of videos of people in 3rd world countries going to the airport to pick up their deceased friend or family member and wheel their remains home in a box. The boxes barely even look like they’re made of plywood. More like cardboard. Seriously you need to learn what sort of culture you’re supporting.

"What a horrible system that I'm sure is pretty common all over the world. I know I saw it in South Korea when I was in the military in the 90's...most of the ladies that worked in the bars around the bases were from other countries (ie Philippines), they were promised to work in a respectful entertainment-type tourism job (lied to) and instead got their passports taken when they arrived and worked in crappy bars serving drinks to nearby military base personnel for a long multi-year contract. Until they finished, they got paid horrible and no passport. Basically slaves. I would refuse to go to any of those bars....and believe me there were a ton of them, probably 90% of them were like that.  The fact govt's all over the world use this system for tourism, world-cups or any other ""money making"" thing makes me sick.  And it's everywhere.  Including in the US itself.  The only way it will stop is if everyone in every country who can and cares does something about it.  For example, if people refused to watch or attend the world-cup...this alone would have been easy to do on a per-person basis but sent an extremely strong message.  TV companies should have refused to cover world cup as well. And shame on weak-ass companies not wanting to sponsor this video.  If a company did sponsor this video, I totally would have went out of my way to buy their product for myself or someone else.",2022-11-23T18:16:48Z,0

@Ja Ha What I mean is it can't be nearly as bad as the conditions in Qatar. I am sure there are mistreatments to migrant workers in Canada as well. I mean expecting them to find a place to live in Toronto while making minimum wage is a mistreatment itself. But it is not as bad as Arabic countries. They treat people from Asian countries like animals. You have thousands of documentaries showing how migrant workers are treated in Arabic countries. As someone who was born in a country that sends people to Arabic countries for cheap labour I know the conditions of people coming back. There was one woman who came back with hundreds of nails in her body. Every time she doesnt do something correct they put nails in her. Now you are saying this is happening in Canadian farms? I am sure there are many people in Canada who would be itching to make documentaries about something like this if that happens in Canada. Also where did you hear Qatar learned this system from Canada. They have been doing this for a very long time. Also Arabs were doing slave trading from the beginning of time. So this is nothing new for them. My question to you was how do you know Qatar leaned this system from Canada?,2022-11-25T05:48:21Z,

"@JoxBackup the conditions were very poor for Filipinos in Canada, especially for Live-in care givers for the elderly and children. They are in a different program than industrial/agricultural workers. That being said, many of the same problems existed. However, Filipinos courageously struggled and won some changes to that program. Look up organizations Migrante Canada or Pinay. Things are not perfect with the program but the Filipinos have improved their conditions. Their resistance and organizing has been an inspiration for other migrant workers and all workers in Canada. To answer your question though... yes, there is a lot of censorship. I encourage you to reach out to people at those two organizations to learn more about the truth of the Filipino worker experience in Canada. You can then warn other workers about the challenges.",2022-11-25T03:13:05Z,

"@Bulldozer  If you wish to make the claim that I am being disingenuous you should provide clear examples of the differences in immigration programs. 

Please provide comparison examples. Choose two topics
- recruiting tactics 
- worker indebtedness
- poor working conditions, safety issues
- segregation 
- closed work contracts, no negotiating power
- wage theft
- trafficking 
- deportation for speaking up
- no pathway to citizenship, 
- no benefits of residents (health, employment insurance, etc.)

It is not an argument that these things happen to a greater degree in Qatar. If they are also happening in Canada, even to a lesser extent, than they are features of the immigration program. Also, a lot of what happens to a worker in Canada happens in their country of origin, before or after arrival. This offshoring of responsibility and oversight does not mean it is not happening in Canada. It means that the program has found an ingenious way from hiding it from the host public. Worker discipline and exploitation happens in the shadows of these kind of narratives. If the labor crosses borders, your analysis of their entire experience must also. The Canadian government is certainly aware of these problems. They shifted from bilateral agreements with States to privatization through agencies and the exploitation exploded. They are aware of this exploitation - extortion, fees, threats, favoritism, et al - the public should be also. Were you aware? 

I also want to point out that I never equated Qatar and Canada in quantifiable ways... I don’t have hard stats on Qatar. It appears nobody has them. All we have are interviews and minor NGO investigations. There really is no way for us to have an accurate side by side, per capita worker harm analysis. I simply said we have the same system with all its components and features of exploitation. This can be verified. I’m not being disingenuous by pointing out that our immigration systems operate by the same logics.",2022-11-25T00:34:43Z,

Hey, I wouldn't be shocked that there are some horrible stories from Canada and such, but overall I find it hard to imagine that kind of thing being systematic over there. I mean, people are literally risking their lives on sea to get to western countries, regardless of how they end up being treated there. No one does that to get to Qatar, surely that means something?",2022-11-25T00:19:59Z,
"It’s disingenuous to equate what Qatar is doing to what happens in Canada, or other western nations for that matter. There is certainly exploitation, a similar thing happens to a much lesser extent in the USA, it happens less now, but both are nowhere near what Qatar does. I agree with you that attention does need to be drawn to it because western nations, like canada, act like they do better and should do better than they really do, but what’s happening in Qatar is another level of exploitation entirely.",2022-11-25T00:03:06Z,
"​@Milos that's your preexisting biases speaking , i have a friend who worked in a farm in Canada and his employer didn't even provide work clothes for him, he was told that if he want something he should buy it himself with the minimum wage he gets . he was living in a remote area so even if he wanted to go somewhere or to buy something he had to ask permission from his employer to use a car otherwise he was stuck in the farm 24/7. 
the point is that the system exists in not only Canada and Qatar but many other countries in the world . what makes the difference are the employers , if you're lucky you will have a good employer who will help you integrate and build your life but usually those who employ foreign workers are looking to exploit them. and btw living in Qatar is way better than living in any western country just for its safety alone.",2022-11-24T23:52:35Z,

"Let's not forget that since WW1 the entire middle east including Qatar has been under British rule and after WW2, the USA inherited the British empire.
There are many US military bases across the arab world, the largest one being Al Udeid in Qatar which are used to exert control over their colonies. Decisions are made in Washington DC and Tel Aviv. The Arab emirs are merely executives. 

American hypocrisy is funny. They command their underlings to commit the crime and then when their underling obeys their orders, they call them out in the media to appear holier than thou. So essentially the US gets to commit the crime and appear as a moral authority at the same time!

"Coming from Singapore (9:27-9:29 😀🇸🇬), our construction sector is also based on labourers from Bangladesh & India (but not Nepal 🤔). Our labour regulations have also made it difficult (though not impossible) for foreign construction workers to change employers.

I don't know if this is this is the case in Qatar, but I've heard the argument-from an employee of a local NGO advocating foreign workers' rights, no less-that local construction firms fork out quite a bit to recruit and fly in their Bangladeshi & Indian employees, so it is a bit unfair to them when those employees jump ship without completing their contract.",2022-11-23T16:50:36Z,1
"That's debt bondage, it's not illegal or quite a violation of human rights, but it's still iffy. Do you think all the workers who signed the contracts fully understood what they were agreeing to and everything that that entails?

I understand that Singapore cannot only rely on local workers to build the country, because it's so small, but that's where the government should sweep in with tighter labour laws to regulate the excesses of the industry. Being ""business friendly"" is often not compatible with having fair laws that protect workers.

Edit to add: I think people should be free to pursue happiness, whether by looking for better employment or moving countries to pursue said happiness. But nothing should force them to stay under one employer. The director of a zoo in Stuttgart (where I live) told us in a tour that they don't cage most of the animals because if the animals want to run away, it means the zoo is not doing a good job taking care of them. I don't want to compare people to animals, but I think companies should think like this too. If you have to build a metaphorical cage to keep your workers, maybe your company is not doing a good job taking care of them.",2022-11-25T13:06:53Z,

"Few years back I watched this documentary from guardian( still available in YouTube)  about working conditions of Nepalese workers in Qatar and it was a sad situation. I thought may be these countries would now stop sending workers to Qatar but no, it never stopped . Remittance from these Arab nations is what functions the countries where these workers are from even today and even more.
I had friends who had gone there for around 150-200 dollars a month wage when at the same time Nepalese were earning 80-100 dollars per month . Some of them called frantically from there and almost all of them vowed to never go back there again.
As a football fan, after billions of dollars spent on infrastructure and event being already started, there is no point in calling this loud unless compensation are demanded and rules are changed (unlikely to happen). At least teams playing could give homage to the workers that build those giant infrastructure and make this event about their hard work and sacrifice and not about the Qatari Goverment.",2022-11-23T16:04:29Z,0

"In retrospect that twist was foreshadowed as far back as the moment we meet ""Tyr"". 

First, when Atreus mentioned him having a spear in the prophecy Odin called it a walking stick. He saw it as an insult because he's old and he thought Atreus saw him as weak, and his pride slipped out. 

Then there was when he suddenly accepted Brok's challenge to making better soup out of the blue. Tyr acted so unmotivated the whole game but the fact that a dwarf did something better made Odin break character in that moment. 

Of course there was Tyr being absent during the whole Garm fiasco. 

As to why he suddenly revealed himself in that moment it was simply his hatred towards a being he deemed lower than him calling him out. His temper finally broke because arrogance is the common trait of gods like him.  Unfortunately, Brok paid the price. I guess if one of the main cast had to die, he or Sindri would thematically make the most sense since they were the first real friends we made on this journey. Hopefully we don't lose anyone else in the finale.",2022-11-23T11:40:39Z,0

So Qatari companies are also exploiting the workers since they know they are poor and evan their countries are don't care what happens to them..
The All Arabian gulf countries are the same if you come from a poor country and you are a Labourer who working the construction companies you evan can't go to the big malls and city centre area they discriminate you by ur look and attire..these Arabian gulf countries have the worst human rights in the world but they pay a millions of dollars to buy their way out..

"Hey, Johnny. In Qatar, most of the people who work there come from poor communities, especially those in India and Pakistan that the UK and European colonies destroyed. Now, those people can do one of two things. First, they can stay in their home country, where they may or may not be able to find enough food to eat.A lot of them can't afford to feed their children. The second option is to work in a country like Qatar, where they get paid, food, medical care, and a place to live. They merely come to work, not to become citizens. Now, reports such as yours will not in any way affect Qatar, but they will damage those individuals who are disadvantaged in a variety of ways. Westerners continue to act as moral agents despite their ignorance of how they negatively impact people.",2022-11-23T06:00:51Z,1

"Another point I would like to mention on how wealthy gulf nations screw up many international sports. It's a well-known secret that many rich gulf nations buy players from poor Arabic-speaking countries. They sign contract with those selected players to represent their country for money. Players have received new names, birth certificates, passports, and better salaries as per their contracts. So if all rich nations can purchase players from other countries for an international game between countries, what is the point of having a global event? In the past, it has occurred in the Olympics, and I am sure we will see it in FIFA as well. Maybe we've already seen it.",2022-11-23T05:40:20Z,0

"I truly feel conflicted about this, I am defending Qatar because I am tired of the double standard. I acknowledge the fact most of the gulf countries are a nightmare to work in. what I hate, is that ppl hate is coming are Islamophobic. every country had a lot of human rights issues but no one wanted to say anything. Brazil threw all the poor ppl just to build stadiums and hid them, there was protest left and right. I don't think Russia needs any intro to human rights violations or against the LGBTQ. There are workers that die and they threaten their families if they speak.  I bet if China would host the world cup, no one would say anything about the Uyghur Muslim genocide. I lived in the middle east for 12 years and everyone thinks all the countries are like the gulf countries. Now they want to mix politics and football, but I remember about 10 years ago, some players supported the victims of war in the middle east and they got fined for it. while England are crying about human rights but they forgot what they did in Africa and the slave trade that was going on for a long time. what I learned in the recent event is that the world defends human rights depending on the oppressor and the victim's skin color. Europe is calling out Qatar for human rights while they still buying oil and gas from them. every one buying Nike but oppressed Muslim workers are making the shoes against their will.",2022-11-23T03:36:40Z,1

I am a big admirer of your work. 
A long time follower and supporter. 

Let’s highlight the conditions of similar workers , in the Eurozone and what the Danish government is planing to move their immigrants to. 

The conditions of similar workers in North America, China and other borders around the globe. 

The timing is interesting, where many media channels are picking on Qatar, over “A” factor of an their economy’s structure. 

Let’s makes a series of workers rights and compare the agony they share to determine which is more .. humain. 

Also, the Qatar size not fitting in the boot of Italy is a shady move.

"Interesting video the point or the plot was absolutely nothing, literally reminds me of any rich country ever and their relationship with immigrants, You have America, France, China, Russia etc etc. I totally believe we should address issues of countries no matter what, but the whole thing how its set up how everyone is suddenly pointing out the issues of Qatar just feels straight out racist, weird that we didnt hear about the torture these workers have to go through any other time but now. Straight up racism, totally unfair. As said we should point issues but this is like a target because never before was a country criticized and targeted just for hosting a sporting event, I mean have u seen what brazil and china do when they host? Anyone points them out? No. I wanna see u make a video for the next world cup or olympics or whatever, wherever it is hosted and point out the issues of those nations. Because you will be doing disrespect to those people you interviewed and your viewers, and will feel more like an easy way to get the views. 

To set things straight I'm not from Qatar, nor Arab or anywhere near, just really disappointed in the racism that has been shown towards them in just  a few weeks like these problems had just occurred and shows that it has nothing to do with human rights but with hatred, especially the media , lets not forget the scandalous bbc hosting of the even which didnt even broadcast the opening of the ceremony. Human right should be addressed 24/7 365, not one day, not one week, not one month. I'll tell you what since such people wont tell you, if you are an immigrant avoid any country such as Arabic countries, USA, China, France or any other country of the world, just go to Germany or Switzerland if you wanna feel like home, there's still some hatred in there too, based on color, religion and ethnicity but it treats you wayy better than any of nation can.",2022-11-23T01:02:06Z,0

I myself as a bachelor would never be able to rent or live  in a building or neighborhood that usually families live in because of simple cultural mindset. Luckily I could afford living in bachelor areas that had standard living condition like any other citizen. But these workers could not.

The Middle East has had this system for decades at this point, they only want to hide it because the world is watching, but as soon as the World Cup is over, most people will return to apathy.

I'm not saying you shouldn't care, but like BLM, like Asian hate crimes in America, posting social media support messages and marching really accomplishes nothing, and actual change inducing actions is too hard and time consuming for almost every human.

If you want to change things, change then with the power you actually have. If you can vote, vote in every election, if you don't support places like Qatar, don't visit, don't buy their products (Qatar Air flights, PSG memorabilia), if you don't like how a company treats it's employees, don't buy from that company.

Compare those workers at Qatar vs Homeless American Citizens. Those Workers dont need to eat food from the trash, beg for money, use infected syringes, sleep outside hot or cold. The point he made was Americans got it worse then non national workers. Why don't we compare benefits of being a Qatari vs American?",2022-11-22T20:46:28Z,
Wtf are you on-is that really your takeaway from this,2022-11-22T20:38:41Z,
"I lived in the Middle East for 18 years.  Yes, there are some issues with migrant laborers, but you must remember that the majority of the companies that hire these laborers are actually owned by expats from India and other countries.  They bring in their own countrymen, and recruit them, giving them an opportunity to make money they may not make in their own countries.  I have talked and worked with quite a few of these individuals, and they are able to send this money back home to support their families. It's not a the best situation for many of them, but they do choose to go and work, mainly because the economic situations in their own countries is far worse!  Is this the case in Europe? What happens to the tens of thousand immigrants who attempt to cross the borders into the European nations?  How are they doing now? What about the immigrants from Central and South America who come to the U.S.?  Have you looked at the situations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. with homelessness!

"first of all, Qatar is a Muslim country and most of their laws are based on our religious views on Islam, we have morals and values that have been passed down many many generations which we can't change just because someone decides that they don't like it doesn't give them the right to ask them to change it. I'm quite baffled how no one is saying anything about Russia, especially when they have laws against LGBTQ2+ for no reason, maybe because its Putin but we have them rules based on the Quran. what are you all scared you're going to get nuclear bombed or what?!
then you're talking about south Asian workers having tough conditions building the stadium, but no one talking about big companies like Nike who have located many of their factories in Asia, like India where many workers are living off less than minimum wage, in very poor conditions in slums. not to mention young children also working there, some of those people have died yet no one seems to mention anything.
oppressing women? - if any of you were actually Muslim or read the Quran you would know that men and women are equal with one another. just because the media decides to portray us Muslims in a bad way like we are terrorists doesn't mean we ALL are bad people! and while we at it the fact that you all helped people of Ukraine when Russia strikes from nowhere but when people of israel attacked the Palestinians and came to your country for help you all turned them away knowing that they risked their life only to get rejected.

For decades, workers have been coming to Qatar from south east Asia willingly (nobody forces them on planes). The workers knows that conditions in their countries (and in Europe) are worse than in Qatar.

A friend of mine and nice Nigerian guy used to work in Qatar for two years as a security officer, now he lives in London but his colleagues are still working there and keep renewing their contract with their agency once it finish every two years. Every agent give their staff 1-2 years contract and once it finish they can go back home or renew their contract.

They have been promised and told so many things for a better paycheck and conditions but once they come….those are just a word to lure the workers to come here. Since i live here and work here for a while. Qatar is like if they can hire you and no need to pay even a single dime, they will! ….no doubt in it and that is what they are trying to do. For some people that says then don’t come, nobody force them to come. But in reality, they came because of the conditions they been told. Once arrived, they will tell you more rules that never been told and twisted everything that been promising. Such as ,take away their passports..that’s something they have never told those workers. I have been interact with many labors. Not all of them, but mostly I have seen they are sad and depressed. I gave them food /snacks/ drinks sometimes they are super happy. Many workers (not all)here are very kind and nice and have a good heart. In qatar is like caste and classes system. Whatever you show in this clip, is 100% true, no filter needed. You should have a look with qatar airways crews too. I heard their rules are also beyond understanding.",2022-11-22T12:09:46Z,0

All these businesses hire companies (Usually Asian companies) to do the labor work. The workers are all working under poor constructions.

Only thing US gets away with, is thats they don’t have to import these workers to do the job. They can work from their own countries.

Meanwhile something like construction on a big scale requires making deal with such companies and bring their workers here.

"Kuwait does the same thing for labor. They call them ""Third Country Nationals"" the bring in Filipino and Indian and Pakistani people to work and they live in these giant apartment buildings and do all the lower paying jobs but aren't citizens. Typically they are segregated with Filipino people doing more inside type lower level work and Pakistanis doing more construction and outside work. They have no rights. The employers hold their passports and do not give them access to it. I was a US soldier in Iraq who had gone to Kuwait and had a bus driver who was Pakistani. He accidentally cut off a driver and the Kuwaiti man pulled in front of us and blocked us. Opened the bus door and started beating the man. We intervened and he spit on me and left. We reported it to the police and the man was brought in and arrested and was hit. I asked why they were hitting him and what kind of trouble he was in for assaulting the bus driver. The policeman reply was ""oh he is not being arrested for that. The man he hit has no rights he is a Pakistani. He is being arrested and beaten for spotting on you American military men. You are guests if the government and this man insulted the government by spitting on you."" So beat the hell out of a man for nothing and you are golden because he is from Pakistan, but spit on an American soldier and you get beaten and jailed. Got it. It turned my stomach, but as a visitor to their country and being told by the US Government not to interfere with local laws and rules when we landed I couldn't do anything other than tell them I didn't think it was right.",2022-11-22T09:14:47Z,0

At the end of the day they make a livings for their families that they cant do in India, go back when Donald Trump was president and visited India, the government in India literally built a wall to cover them on the road Trump was passing threw so the government in India are at fault for not giving these people opportunities.

This exploitive labors is not unique. It is quite common both in history and today. Not just in far of lands of countries like Qatar.  This is happening in our own back yard. In the urban core of USA (like San Francisco, Chicago) and the Rural Heartland (like Texas). With migrants and to prisoners. In the backwoods of California, foreign citizens are tricked/trapped and give fake guns to guard illegal weed crops and when the police show up they are shot. The cause of death is known and they are label as ""acceptable deaths"" even publicized.  The USA (as well as German, Japan, UK, Russia) was built in labor conditions similar to those shown in the video, yet no parallel was drawn.Though the brutality is less common and perhaps less systemically accepted here but why tell these ""exotic"" stories about ""exotic"" crimes. These are regular crimes, by regular people, in far off places. By Other-izing anyone, even perpetrators, gives dangerous people a weapons to influence average person. 

I am certain this is not your intent and I agree with your core argument  'world doesn't have to be like this.' You, Me, We, Us can work to change it. Besides letting people know that this is happening, nothing else is offered. It is just spectacle with now substance.  There really isn't any education in this video, just entertainment. What to do to spot it in our communities or how do we help those trapped in it, How do we escape when trapped. What does solidarity with the laborers look like. All you give the victims is our pity, and people can't do anything with our pity. Your style though it has given you amazing public success, and it doesn't challenge anyone with actual power or help people change.

This video is really annoying Johnny because you missed the BIGGER STORY. I suspect that this is because of your own lens and how you view the subject. The real story is not so much the Qatari's who implemented the Kafala system (with few exceptions it's the same right across the Middle-East) but rather the companies who freely choose to work within it. The Qatari's themselves are lazy and indolent and don't know the meaning of hard work - you think they want to get their hands dirty doing this ? For sure they don't - the real scandal is the collusion of very well known international companies in the system. Qatar is full of American and European companies very happy to take the Qatari money and operate the system they designed. American and European companies partner with Qatari state enterprises to develop and exploit Qatar's hydrocarbon resources and American and European companies provide good and services by the bucket load. They all reap the commercial and financial benefits of this system. It's profoundly annoying that your limited focus made you completely to the real scandal - the Qatari's are part of a bigger Middle-East problem with their elites but the American and European companies WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER and have NO EXCUSES about what they are doing represent the real scandal. Then there's the story about the collusion of the home Governments and nationals of the migrant workers - that's a whole other story.

And for those who don't know, they treat non-Qatari Arabs the same way. And they force them to live in the blue areas too. And, they pay a white person with western citizenship 5-10 times more than an Arab with western citizenship. That's how extreme they are.",2022-11-22T03:52:09Z,0

I used to live in a compound in Industrial are between 2011-2014. Poverty was everywhere. Local Police(Al Fazah) always coming to spy on the compounds. They dont want you to film cuz its shows the modern slavery and how the system takes peoples documents and trap you there without getting pain and cramping 24 people into a 3 bedroom flat with bunk beds.

I am sure so many rich guys at Qatar gonna be butthurt after watching this video. They should be. These gulf countries take advantage of their oil to make slaves out of people who come from countries to work for them.  Khafala is not only in Qatar but it’s in the whole Gulf.  I wanna know what these countries would have been like if they never had oil in their lands. Johnny should cover a story of this again but this time after the World Cup.  Just to see what has happened to the blue area,2022-11-22T03:33:06Z,0
I am 100% against this exploitation and the evidence seems to me is pretty clear. But I also want to say that I think it is not fair to just criticise the gulf countries only. In fact most of the workers face on par exploitation in their home countries for even less money and benefits. Also it's not only the Arabs that benefit from this exploitation the big companies of the world arguably have benefitted way more from this by hiring cheap labour in the home countries for even less wages. The point I'm trying to make is we should highlight this issue on a worldwide scale instead of pointing out bordering on slander of only one region.,2022-11-22T03:32:14Z,0

"Not every country qualifies for high-standard labor conditions, Qatar isn't the only one, definitely not the worst.
Accidental construction casualties happen everywhere around the world, it's not specific to that country, the point is safety measures.
Americans are used to seeing the world through their world-peace lens, it's ironic when we see a film like Nomadland (2020 film) that we know the evil one in their viewpoint is Amazon which makes their lives convenient yet they take it for granted without acknowledging that it comes with a hefty price paid by the pyramid-bottomed laborers..
It's hilarious when the host states ""What OOO Doesn't Want the World to See "", well, no people, let alone an entity, wants to let others see their weakness or ugly parts, it's conventional sense.
And according to the pre-production statements, he's well prepared, unfortunately, he, in person physically, can't reach the country, then there are interviews from his seeds, via video clips, no first hand resource, way too less convincing.
In a nutshell, this is a shit-digger film. Still, the host is an excellent mapper and provocateur.",2022-11-22T03:18:38Z,0

"I lived there most of my childhood, this is only the tip of the iceberg. People there and their mindsets are boggling and horrific, they see everyone that isn't a Qatari as a lower lifeform and treat them poorly depending on where they came from. They see people from certain countries as nothing but a stepping stone to live in luxury. 
Horrible acts go from, shaming, insults, lowering payments, threatening, and beating. 
Also, beating someone for not doing their job right is a common thing, it's insane, and their excuse is always ""They're just (racial slur) and lazy and want to get money for free. They should be grateful we even hired them, it's better than where they came from."" 
Living conditions are even worse, they live in terrible cramped rooms and have bad healthcare. There are servants too, like maids and drivers that have to live with their employers and do their bidding 24/7 and their living conditions are not decent either.

It gets worse and worse, your life is basically in the hands of someone who's of higher status than you.

"Qatar was created by the CIA and MI6 and is, even now, controlled by them. 
Of course, they use local proxies as a front government royal family.  
Al Jazeera is the voice of all that.  
Part of Qatar's role is to serve as local leverage against Saudi Arabia in case it's needed. 
Similarly, reports like this video are used to maintain world pressure against Qatar so that they don't get too uppity, (as filthy rich Arabs are prone to do when they can get away with it).
The US maintains a lot of military there (discreetly) as advisors, embassy guards etc etc. And the US Al Udeid Air Base is located just outside of Doha Qatar. It is home to the headquarters of United States Central Command (USCC) and United State Air Force Central Command (USAFCC).  Qatar was also the headquarters for the entire US military operation involved with the invasion and occupation in Iraq. So the US uses Qatar to maintain pressure on Saudi Arabia, and it uses world opinion and a very strong US military presence to maintain pressure on Qatar.   As long as they don't rebel too strongly, they are allowed to be millionaires and to abuse their foreign workers.  No problem there.
But if there is ever a need to do so, Qatar can be justly vilified and blamed for abuses and can  be destroyed economically or even physically in just a few days.  
I don't think anyone would even dare to make a video like this unless they had some sort of ties to, or at least permission from the US intelligence network.",2022-11-22T00:21:58Z,0

"Thank you for the informative and detailed video. Whereas I was aware that there is funny business going on in Qatar, being aware of something and knowing the details is very different, yet knowing doesn't change the outcome. This ultimately brings me to my point. Just like you state in your closing line, it's very likely that people will forget about all of this, and look elsewhere, onto the next big thing.
Looking at things logically, it is possible that Qatar will temporarily follow through with their promises but then go back to the modern slavery system once the international attention shifts elsewhere. The everyday folk, even if banded together, don't have the power and influence needed to see actual change. What's most likely to occur should go like this:
- The world cup passes, Qatar still in the spotlight
- Some well-intentioned people will try to get justice for the forced laborers, but the Qatar government will at that point start using bribes and business deals to keep these people quiet. If that doesn't work, then the higher ups of the justice seekers will get bribed, and the justice seekers will either drop the matter, or lose their jobs and try to shed light on the matter.
- The rich and the influential won't really care enough to play heroes, unless there is tangible benefits to be had.
- Regardless of how the events progress, eventually the international audience will look elsewhere. Then, the cycle of exploitation will continue.

TLDR: People are hypocritical, it's just that everyone's hypocrisy is to a different degree. People might say things like ""this is wrong, do the morally correct thing"", but how many are actually willing to dedicate their own time, money and effort for a matter that most likely has no personal effect on them?
As for the people that are affected, it's all poor village families. From any governmental POV, it is not cost effective to actually pursue the matter. Even if the families of the victims manage to group together, they will at most perform a few protests, without any actual results.

My point is, how many of the viewers here actually care about matters that have no effect on you? I might be fatalistic in my way of thinking, but honestly, so many events in history have concluded in a similar manner already.",2022-11-22T00:09:01Z,0

"This is sad. The condition that people ""work"" in (slavery isn't work) are terrible - but the question also should be: why anyone would go to try their luck in condition like that... There are a lot of comments here from people that know someone who worked/is working there - so those conditions are known. And still people go... Because their lives (in their home countries) are bad enought to go: for better future.
There is a lot of social and historical background to take into consideratian (also culture)... It is ethically bad, and at the same time: how many of those men came back home to gave their families better lives :/ 
Pretending that we are surprised that rich people can do everything they want, won't fix the issues.
This is also sad how you are building your narration - overly dramatic, using music and suspense (pretending that it may not be a story at all, because you haven't found anyone to talk - that video is half hour long... it is obvious that you menage to do it) to make it more entertaining. I get that this is captivating for audience, but it is disrespectful to people that suffered there.

"Johnny, I love the stories you pick to tell and you're obviously talented at editing and creatively organizing your stories. I've thoroughly enjoyed your videos overall with how you handle the facts while not shying away from serious problems that arise in your study of the subject. This story is no different, thank you for working hard to bring it to light. If I may be so bold as to offer an opinion; as cool and fascinating as your creative process genuinely is, it's a little rough to wade through 17min of setup before finally getting to the meat of the story and the main reason I wanted to watch. It felt very much like a ""how to get the story"" rather than a ""Here is the story"" which may not have been your intent. Maybe just giving a quick blurb stating that it was very difficult to put this one together and if we're super interested in your personal journey we can watch a seperate video that digs into that aspect? Still a fan either way.",2022-11-21T19:38:01Z,7

"This YouTuber is ignorant and wants you to be a trend. You, O West, are killing tourists and workers in a very big way. We do not go to the West for fear of killing workers, which is widespread, and this is much worse than the thing you claim about Qatar, and the deportation of workers is because of the expiration of their residency. And this is normal for the state to say that they will be deported to the countries of the world. Whoever has a residence permit, this is legal!So you look and solve the problem of the rape of female workers by their boss. It will be better for your country before you speak. Oh my God, the rates of killing expatriate workers in the countries of Europe and America are terrifyingly large. We are here talking about killing, not working hours.

"@Jet Sanchez Would you say the kafala system is a crime uniquely deserving of taking a sporting event away? Most of this didn't come to light until way after the development process was underway, and you can't cancel a world cup. You could say something similar about China when they host the olympics; ""oh, no country is currently committing genocide like China does."" The US and UK perpetuate the Gulf for their selfish reasons, and have committed a host of crimes over the past decades. (With a death toll far exceeding Qatar's).

These events are perfect opportunities to bring to light the crimes of those hosting (esp Qatar) and decry their arrogance. But to say the event is a farce and that someone else should have won the bid is kind of weak and biased. This is a globalized world and everyone exploits & buys each other. The west is more tongue-in-cheek about it. The fact is if Qatar had done all these crimes in, say, the 90s to build these stadiums and then hosted today it wouldn't be a front and center media issue, because many who have their own skeletons in the closet find them easier to digest when they claim to be innocent in the present. (And don't bring up the past for optics).",2022-11-23T17:02:27Z,
"@Peer Since the bid is announced over a decade in advance this point doesn't really stand. Most countries need to build extra stadiums (Brazil, SA, etc) Were those World Cups also unnecessary? Hosting the WC isn't an exclusive club. If FIFA makes it so it will be harder for new countries to break into the establishment. That said FIFA and the entire process is very corrupt, across the board. Profit is the goal for all parties involved, this really shouldn't be surprising.",2022-11-23T16:35:05Z,

"@Saad Qazi Any country that doesn't utilize modern slavery to the scale and degree that Qatar does. You may say this happens in other countries. Sure,  but that doesn't justify what's happening in Qatar. Not to mention they only got to host the event because of corruption. Their bid won over the US and UK bids. Those are countries that in 2010 had more than enough facilities and resources to host the World Cup ten times over. In that same year Qatar had nothing in terms of football arenas and athlete facilities. They're spending several magnitudes of order more than many past World Cup bidders combined.

"Why are you so surprised about this? Migrant workers are treated like garbage everywhere in the world. It is not the story of Qatar alone. If you’re really concerned about the plight of workers, fight for them as a whole. Stop bashing qatar because it is the hottest cake in the market. Europe was built by the migrant workers from south asian countries experiencing same plight. Now, europe doesnt need infrastructure so they will spread propaganda about how workers are treated badly in developing nations while forgetting what they did in the past.",2022-11-21T19:09:13Z,0

The biggest case was the death sentence without prior notification to Indonesia embassy, Tuti Tursilawati. She was forced to had sex with the man of the house, and defended herself. 

I'm not surprised of how Middle East treats most of the Asian people because it's not new for me.

They live out of plastic boxes.. everything cluttered and unhealthy at times. They choose to reside because of the low cost of the rent. So they can save up for future. 
Sure . Labour camps are horrible but this is exactly how every Arab country worker places are ... Horrible. And people assume it to be the way out to get some money in the world. Rather suffer here than back home. There are plenty of camps out there. Also. It's the damn work sponsors and private companies who misuse these men.

"Basically the world just looked the other way when Qatar was mistreating the labor when it was building the country for the world cup for a decade, and now after the damage is done the media is talking about it, I wonder why? is it because Qatar banned any representation for the LGBTQ community in the world cup!!?  nah I don't think so",2022-11-21T16:18:40Z,5

Problem is this is not just about Qatar. Labour bargaining power is at all time low. Capitalist class will get away with survival wages wherever they can. There is an element of consent in the way how these migrants labour choose to work. But that doesnt mean labour should be expolited and be paid less than survival wages.

-check whether these recruiting companies that trap people are actually controlled by the Qatari government or are managed by people of the same nationalities of the workers?
-consider that EVERYONE resident in Qatar have access to free healthcare
-consider that the kafala system has been recently abolished in Qatar
-consider what were the working conditions of the workers in other World Cups such as Russia 2018

"This is excellent journalism from the entire team, but I urge you to look further into this story.
As much as we would like to believe that steps are being taken to improve the conditions of expat workers, they will not be able or allowed to integrate into those societies as they currently are.
My parents were expats (in one of the GCC neighbors of Qatar) for 30+ years now and I was born an expat.
Now I'm 29 years old and an engineer in the same country and I have to work with a lot of laborers and expat workers. A lot of them are my good friends who have invited me to their places of residence as I helped them out in various ways that I possibly can.
After visiting the labor camps & dorms where they live, most of the people just want to get their debts back home cleared, earn money for their marriages or family, and are yearning to get back home. Facilities & amenities are provided, but it's not enough for the sheer number of people in these camps. A lot of these companies running the camps are just looking to make their pockets fatter by overcrowding and under-providing.
But at the same time, some people find it difficult to integrate themselves into society or ""family zones"". When you live in an authoritarian country, you have no choice but to follow the laws and rules of the same country. If its no alcohol in public places, then you mustn't drink in public places. Chewing tobacco which is quite common in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is illegal here. But they cannot go without it, and they find it in places where it is sold illegally. Such small things which might be okay to do back home, are considered illegal in these countries. If you are caught, then that's the end of your life here (I've seen it go in more ways than one!).

Unfortunately, when people are presented with all of these facts, they come to the conclusion of ""The middle east exploits workers"". But the reality is many of these countries are VERY new. They haven't had much time to develop robust systems to avoid issues like this as they try to ride the wave of economic growth. 

What has happened out of this is that the agencies and recruitment companies simply exploit the system. I have a strong feeling that the recruitment companies are essentially people from the same countries that the workers are from.

And please do not think that this is a long time ago and we should forget about it. Because it has only been 140 years ago. Furthermore, if you want something recent from the 21st century, then here it come, I myself am from Iraq and what the US has done to my country for the last half century is unspeakable and when my people went to Europe, they are treated like shit. They are treated in Europe and US with utter discrimination and racism.
They can't even get descent jobs there. Nor get to travel without being harassed. 
So please take a look at yourselves first Europeans and US citizens before criticizing us Arabs. You destroyed our countries in order to steal our natural resources and when we try to fight back, then we are labeled as terrorists. 
The hypocrisy of the West and the US is beyond belief.

"As some have mentioned, this is common throughout the rich Gulf countries. However, having spent some time as a white collar expat in both Qatar and the UAE, from my limited perspective things seemed to be worse in Qatar.

In general and from my limited perspective, Emiratis were much nicer people than Qataris. I saw Qataris being very unpleasant towards these workers and were indifferent/arrogant towards expats. I never saw Emiratis being unpleasant towards workers and they were very nice and hospitable towards me. 

Also, in UAE there are malls that are geared towards Emiratis and malls geared towards workers. Some of the workers' malls are nicer than many malls in the US, so at face value the workers seem to be recognized a bit more as an integral part of their economy and country.

Granted, none of this is representative of what happens behind the scenes in UAE but I believe that it is a clue to the fact that it is much better for workers than Qatar.",2022-11-21T13:06:45Z,1
"In both countries there are many places euphemistically termed 'family only' or 'bachelors not allowed'. On face value not wanting somewhere to be inundated with single men and allow more freedom to females may seem nice. Until you realise, a rich single man (especially European/White or local) would never be turned away. And most people on workers' visa cannot sponsor their family and so are permanently excluded.",2022-11-22T17:33:21Z,
From India my perspective. Shameful for me that my country's citizens have to work there. Yes many muslims opt for these countries like qatar thinking that it's a islamic country so they will have better future there. I'm not saying hindus or other religion people don't go there. But more than that it's my country failure to provide them the work and providing proper information to the workers. I hope in future we will be able to provide them the jobs here or at least train them better so that they rather go to a better country like europe etc.,2022-11-21T13:06:41Z,0

i grew up in the gulf so i know this is true. anyone who has lived there for more than a year could also attest to it. in the gulf people are categorized by their passports in a rigid hierarchy. this hierarchy more or less follows the hdi ranking of the world. but as well as white westerners at the very top are the native locals who are untouchable so you don't want to get into any argument with them because even if you're on the right side of the law on paper in reality you're the one getting not only yourself but your whole family deported. at the bottom are the south asian laborers who make up the bulk of the population pyramid and are not even allowed to bring their families with them like professional and white-collar workers are. everyone is there on a temporary basis at the mercy of their employer no matter how many years they live there or even if they were born there. citizenship is only patrilineal and everyone else has to pay $800 a year per person to renew their residency and/or work permit.,2022-11-21T12:09:44Z,0

"Instead of forcing other cultures to do as we do. Help the countries of those you do not wish to see enslaved. I feel like the strategy of ""DO IT because I said so, because God said so, because it is what X society views as good."" A change in strategy is needed to shape the world towards better human standards. When together we help each other be safe from the abusers awful people in power lose their ability to control us. This reporting is amazing but it will not be seen, maybe, by those you filmed to use in it. We must share information, true facts, with everyone. Specially those who suffer ignorance of their own doom. Look at our own communities in the ""rich"" nations we live in. You think we do not harbor human trafficking, exploitation of the basic liberty of life from those of any age, man, woman, child. Our neighbors scream and we just make sure the door is locked, our streets always littered with screaming sirens, and we walk right past the homeless who we know exist and yet...we try oh so hard to ignore or even find disgust in them. Yet every month when a new world or national event happens...

There we are on our moral war. Screaming in every direction for the same improvements in the quality of living for those who have it worst. It is easier to find comfort in the misery of others and validation in being a savior to whom we deem weaker than us. Regardless if we were asked to or not. All of it just to avoid the easiest step towards a much better world. 

""Hello, do you need help? Because I do.""

We can be better. We will be better. Reports like this one are amazing and they show a lot that is needed to always keep in mind how truly monstrous humans are. The end is always the miss for me however, that ""Let us never forget X thing is the reason of our suffering and if we end it! We will be happy and peace will reign!"" Violence and more hate even against those monsters, will only ever make it more of the same somewhere else. At a different time. As it always has. 

Love yourself and hopefully if we start with in us to those around us. Thing will change and actually make sense.",2022-11-21T11:33:38Z,0

"Nice vid but you've mixed up some things and i'd like to clarify it.

*Kafeel is basically a citizen/company thats reponsible for employee actions and required to provide life needs for free such as food and home. Companies mostly abuse and treat employees. However normal citizen literally build strong relationships with their employees.

What you been explaining is kafala system being abused and its illegal. It happens even in Kuwait/UAE/KSA
Kafala system is basically, you get residence as long as you work for a citizen/company. If you do not have a kafeel you're not allowed to stay in country. However government gives you 1-3months duration to leave the country or find a new kafeel.

The way certain companies abuse it is they go to poor countries advertise that for X amount of money they can hire them to work in Doha for much higher than what they actually get. However what some employees doesn't notice is they sign in for working for X years or pay X money to cancel the internship and with a bit of corruption those companies sign contracts with the government.

I do not agree nor support their working environment nor the way they being treated. I think its inhuman.

TL:DR: Certain companies abuse kafeel system and with a bit of corruption here n there the get to sign contracts with government. What we've seen in video is not an actual kafeel system its basically human trafficking.",2022-11-21T11:23:34Z,0

"@Grig RP Qatar doing them a favour by not letting their family starve????
How? By providing them meat of family member's corpse? They are not doing them favour, it's exploitation by taking advantage of poor and uneducated people. They are forced to work in extreme conditions and most of them not even getting paid, then they are forced to protest which is considered ILLEGAL according to law of Qatar. Then protesters are deported back to their home country without any wages getting paid after many months of work in extreme conditions. Not all of them return in good  condition, some of them return in casket without any compensation. Number of deaths is probably between 5-10 thousand, Qatar label it as natural consequence. And workers has taken loan to work, how are they going to pay it?",2022-11-22T09:05:15Z,

As for Qatar, obviously job advertisement and placement agents do not tell the risks. Of course, not every employer is a jerk, so some workers find the compromise worth it. Yet another group ends up being brutally abused and exploited. It gets covered in news time to time and sometimes we hear some governments issuing advisory against taking jobs in  some middle eastern country.

My opinion regarding the living accommodations , the government strictly forces the companies to put there workers in good spaces to live, but how the workers will use these spaces with their lifestyle is their privet matters no one should interfere because this is disrespect for them , or the companies can put inspectors and cleaners for their workers if that your opinion. in another side each country has it own culture live with it govern it in how it suit it, not necessary to anybody in the world like or not it but at least it’s good for their people. at last we the people of Qatar we care about the human rights more then anyone. you didn’t see how we treating them everyday. it’s not in our culture to say all the good we do for the people because it will turn hypocrisy ,but we do the good and we forget about it.",2022-11-21T09:54:44Z,3

"@yasees khanSee ground reality can be very different from what r written on papers. I feel u should see for yourself. I had been to Dubai on a vacation,not Qatar and i have seen. The standards of migrants in the gulf r way way below the European migrants. If u want a job in Europe u need to know the language,the workers from my country living in Dubai didn't even know Arabic.

Now u will say that y r migrants coming to Qatar and not going to Europe ??
Its bcz they r being offered a job without a lot of paper work,without learning Arabic,also they don't get citizenship and it's easier to immigrate to gulf than to Europe. Also u will notice it's only the poor Indian father that migrates to the gulf with his wife and children still in india,while richer indian immigrants who immigrate to the west take their wife and children along with them and their children r raised in the west.
Lastly there is not much salary difference between a sweeper in Germany and an engineer in Germany,while the pay-gap is vast in the gulf.This allows the exploitation of the poor like confiscating of passports,etc.",2022-11-21T11:01:41Z,

1. Anyone can walk in and walk out of industrial zone (senayya).

2. Death rate in Qatar is still pretty low despite all this construction.

3. Migrant worker life quality is a regional problem in the middle east. But people still choose to go there because there is absolutely no way the other rich countries like the US or UK would hire them.

4. The police are friendly and you can go to them any time.

5. The US air base in Qatar has worse contractors who pay far less and give less rights to their workers.

6. Him telling that he can't enter the zone in complete bullshit. You can just hop on an Uber and do it.

having lived there for more than 14 years i never really understood the depth of this migrant worker crisis and not once did any one ever cover this without any compelling evidence or footage .All they talked about was only the negative side about qatar ,telling  everyone that qatar is the bad guy and how they should not associate with them arabs . the western media always wanted to portray themselves as the good guys and how they care about human rights but come on , we all know by now how  hypocrite they can be .this was very obvious , so no one actually took them seriously .

"This is one of those totally needed-to-be-covered stories. 
(That is done each time and every time it gets a bunch of people ""screaming"" and arguing for a bit and every time it gets forgotten until the next year or three by most people as it is not impacting their own lives.)

But the way this video has been done, to me, comes over as some weird conspiracy topic done by some guy/s half out of their mind waiting for their doors to be kicked in by some secret police force only they know about.

I understand that this kind of presentation might be needed nowadays to ""draw in"" the younger audience that wants/needs constant ""action"" even if it is just some overdone camera movements and overplayed ""Oh my god this is big stuff!"" and ""look at my zoomed-in face!""
but bloody hell.

For someone who grew up as a kid and teenager watching documentaries and journalistic stuff on (German) TV in the 90s and early 2000s with my parents pertaining to all kinds of topics but most memorable all things WW2 this overstyled/oversensationalized and chaotic/messy way to present facts only serves to throw up doubts about those facts. 
(As my father was born in the late 1930s he would even drag me out of bed on school day late evenings/nights to have me watch hours-long accounts of soldiers and non-soldiers of all partaking nations and of survivors of the Holocaust and the war and occupations overall as a way to show his son what kind of fucked up shit war and its consequences are as well as how people can go about justifying any action if they are willing/incentivized enough.)

The whole ""look at this suspicious map"" part...just lead with the last part from this video. 
State your big question/concern then show the map and just directly go into where and what that map shows instead of doing this bullshit sensational conspiracy thing and intersperse it with the foootage of those indentured/debt work slave camps that the person that was in actual danger of being grabbed by authorities filmed.
Add some relevant statistics and footage and done.
That way you don't have as many people who would be naturally skeptical of things a younger man/crew would present to them and that are simply not inclined to look up provided references dismiss your whole investigative work as much or as quickly.

"Well all I can say as an Arab to these workers, thank you for ur work. We will actually have the best World Cup ever.
And I am sorry for the conditions u have worked in. But as a responsible person who thinks rationally… I can only tell u to ligma ballz. Bro u all actually knew it is a very hot country, because it’s obviously a desert. Otherwise it’s been freaking 10 years since this whole thing started, so the two questions I am asking myself rn:
1- why didn’t you leave Qatar and looked for another place to work
2- The rumors about this bad conditions were spread back in 2014 all around the world, so why u guys kept on moving to Qatar to work there
3- How the actual f*ck western media can relate to these people while they actually just don’t know how their culture functions.

The reason for the bad hygiene is the people themselves.
Ofc as a western person u would say “ what do you mean by that?”
Well are you awaiting from the government in Qatar to wash these people asses? 
People just don’t understand that pretty much or I would say 90% of these workers don’t know or have a concept of hygiene.
These people were actually poor in the poorest countries in the world.
And I am speaking from my experience, I had to live with these people temporarily when I came to Germany, so u could tell from the way our kitchen looked like or the bathrooms that these people actually just don’t know how to clean themselves, because their wifes or mothers did this type of work back in their countries.
Listen I am not denning that it was a bad situation there but also can’t ignore these aspects because they explain a lot about the way these people lived in Qatar.

Just for you all to remember, they got paid with salaries they could dream of in their home countries for someone who worked without any educational degrees. 
All I can say rn, enjoy the World Cup and stop to try hard to find evidences to cancel this wonderful event because if u want to look for things that went pretty much bad, u can find it pretty much in every World Cup that happened before Qatar 2022.",2022-11-21T09:30:10Z,0

But these governments in the past years, have changed a lot of laws in order to address the abuse of labor by private companies and supervisors ,Such as canceling the (kfalati) law in which the worker is linked to the citizen, and enacting a law that strictly prohibits the work of workers in the sun at a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, and enacting a law that prevents taking the passport from the worker.  (And by the way, these supervisors come from the same countries as the workers)  So far, no one wants to talk about these laws or suggest realistic laws that are better for these workers when talking about this issue.   And no one wants to talk about the responsible developing countries from which these workers and managers come ,  And about the labor recruitment companies registered in these developing countries that steal these workers in order to come to the Arabian Gulf,  And about the responsibility of these developing countries, at least, to prevent the arrival of these workers if these countries are really so bad,  So far, no one wants to talk about this issue with fairness and justice , By the way, if these labor contracts were to be called slavery, then a third of the labor contracts are not only in the Third World, but the whole world is slavery.",2022-11-21T09:23:23Z,0

"The recruitment fees are taken by the company that has got the contract which is run by the Nepali, Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi people the Qatar government just give the contract, they have zero involvement in these recruitment fees, bossing around worker making them work overtime, etc, it's their own people who get this contract and exploit their countrymen, the only place Qatar is failing is not policing this contractor but also it's not easy to do that because they are too shrewd.

this is a hitjob on the Qatar government, and you are a clown Mr. Harris, what you showed in the video is nothing that is not alleged about Qatar, and your claim is unsubstantiated and very biased towards the qatari government you are trying to invoke the western audience because they like getting high on harsh realities. 

The workers are actually in way better condition than their homes, go visit a big city in India, Bangladesh, or Nepal, and they live in dirtier, unhygienic environments with worse housing than what is shown in your own video.

and excluding workers from the main city is nothing wrong, you don't want these men to be inside your city and act unruly and create a problem for locals, they are here to work after all, and hardly anyone of them can afford to live in the city center or do any activity because it is super expensive.

Another point that should be noted is the USA has it's biggest military base in the region, in Qatar, yet until recently has made absolutely no comment about the conditions of these poor migrant workers, many of whom will be involved in supporting the infrastructure of this large US base.
Western countries are happy to accept the Qatari money, they have massive investments in the London and Paris for example, yet turn a blind eye to human rights issues. So much hypocrisy going on. It's all disgusting.

"I worked in Qatar 10 years ago as a white European collared worker. What they also did was that on Fridays (the one day these workers don't work) most of the malls and tourist areas were for ''families only'' so they were not allowed in. One day I went with a colleague from Ethiopia on a Friday to a mall to eat. I go through the gates with no problem and I look behind me and he is not allowed in. I got back to the security guard and they tell me that it is a family-only day and they will not let my colleague in, so I reply that this is my brother.. somehow that worked and they let him in.",2022-11-21T07:43:25Z,0

"Before brexit, millions of post soviet citizens migarted to UK to work mainly in factories & construction. Most of them went there with agencies, that also overpromised salaries, living and working conditions & took money in advance. Eventually, they end up sleeping in buildings made of shipping containers & 6-10 people in every room & wotking for 12hours a day in dangerous conditions. 
Also, I heard tons of stories: people where paid in advance to those ""work agencies"", & after arriving, there was no work & no living place, now they were homeless & abroad. Its not exactly UK governments fault, but the fact is, most of the countries don't care about migrants rights & life conditions, also that their companies & citizens are scamming migrants. 

In US, as a migrant you also can't lose a job, because your working visa will be canceled in like few days (you don't have time to find a new job). This system enables modern slavery. Companies Owns tons of people & governments look aside, because its beneficial for them.

I think that most of countries treat work migrants as temporary slaves that will be returned to their original countries after some time. 
Some countries are worse than others in that matter, like Qatar or Dubai..",2022-11-21T07:00:17Z,0
"this was a very selective, surface level, myopic video which without context is just a commentary of bigoted & racist double standards of the white west..

i m not defending qatar here, but please tell me which major city in the world has not build on slave labour since earlier days & by labourers in really bad conditions in mordern times. which country in the world doesn't have zoning system, segregating rich & poor classes of people even on racist lines, even in the developed cities, national capitals of the modern world.

what i see in this video, the wokers coming from asian & african countries & their living condition.. they're living in badly made flats, settlements which indeed is poor & deplorable but.. 
yes i know i'm sounding bad by adding 'but' here, please hear me out here, most of these workers are coming from countries where their own people, authorities, govts. treat them even worse that's why they're coming to qatar on the first place to leave that, earn money & make a better life for themselves in their home countries bcoz their home countries currently don't care for them as they're poor & isn't that even worse than what's qatar is doing to them, in a way qatar is providing them some employment which their own countries weren't able to do themselves. 

these countries (in asia/africa) didn't even asked, negotiated, better working conditions for their people - basics like comfortable/flexible working hours given the harsh climate of qatar, minimum wage, healthcare, insurance these could have been ensured by native govts. diplomatically given the different trade leverage with qatar many countries of these nations have esp. india, given that this was a long term employment known since 2010 when qatar won the bid to host the world cup. 

these workers in their own countries they live in slums, next to open sewage water bodies with no legal electrical, water, sewage system or any basic amenities, infrastructure there.. so what exactly are you talking about johnny, isn't this is the world we live in.. see i don't have a problem with you showing this, the problem is your pov of showing this as a qatar only problem & as if the rest of the world has been any better to its builders/ labourers/ workers since forever. 

*note - i'm an indian student, i know in my own country people live in much worse condition than this, all year round many even all their lives have lived in those slums. India has one of asia's & world's biggest slums where a large native population lives. more than 90% of Indians earn less than 300$ per month. majority of the world's population is poor. us/europe & rich nations is not the world, everywhere poor people struggle everyday living just hand to mouth. 
so please expland your pov & built  a more wider & diverse perspective not just a white american male's pov of the world, which doesn't help in anything other than villainising & shaming the developing world.. do better 🙂👍🏽

"Just lost a lot of respect for you. Gone through 20 minutes of what I can best describe as drama. What nonsense are you spewing mate? As someone who went to Qatar and went into this ‘so called zone’ on a daily basis - the cricket stadium is literally in Asian Town and called the Asia Town Cricket Stadium - there are ZERO security checks. There’s no ‘arrest’ for going around with a camera or for being white. We had guys from Australia and Netherlands with us. We had cameras and crew. Never ever had a problem. This isn’t journalism. This is just a sham. December 2019 was the height of production. There was the FIFA club World Cup there too - I was at the semi final and final. You could’ve gone to Doha and gone to these areas and come back without any trouble. What an absolute mockery.

I lived in that Gulf area for quite long time, and sometimes I had the opportunity to talk with workers of any kind, and it seems that nobody is really happy about conditions and terms of their contracts. Some type of jobs are slightly better, due to not expose to direct heat or high physical work. These categories, like taxi drivers, customer services related fields, building security etc, have a bit of more dignity. Construction yard workers though, they are the most doomed ones. Gardeners, cleaners... also, and whoever have to work outside, especially during summer.

Their accomodations are all like the one showed in this video. They share rooms between even 10 ppl, and usually there is only one big room with toilets and showers, and a common kitchen for the entire building.

Sad but true, especially because western countries leaders perfectly know this, but they don't say anything about. Opposite, they shake hands and sign deals and agreements with these nations.",2022-11-21T06:53:35Z,0

I agree with everything you pointed out. And I am in no way defending Qatar. But it’s interesting to see human behavior, especially behavior coming from North America and west Europe when it comes to non Europeans doing exactly what US and European companies have been doing since 17th century.

Also, I’m sure you don’t believe Qatar as a nation state goes into south Asian countries by themselves. They are assisted by south Asian governments and companies to find the most desperate.

But people do the same thing in nearly every country. Teenagers in the US sign up for the military because they live in the middle of nowhere and they see the military as the only way they can make their life better. People sell drugs because the alternative is getting paid minimum wage. Migrant workers cross borders to live on someone's farm and work for next to nothing doing backbreaking labor.

The situation there is much direr than the footage shows, and if we can get videos out of Iran, we technically could get them out of Qatar too.

"Indeed it is very sad to see this happened and still happening to many people are being exploited by no only Qatar. The story should not be on Qatar, it should be about modern slavery and exploitation of people who want to earn their living and work in such condition to live and support their family. 

I personally grow up in a neighbouring country to Qatar and the system is even worst than what happening in Qatar. that is why the story should not focus on Qatar only rather it should be on Modern Slavery. In that neighbouring county where I spend more than 18 year, i have see this kind of exploitation and literal slavery and even as you mention they have worst system called Kafalah. 

But my question is why QATAR and why now this kind of bashing against  Qatar, America (USA) is not doing the same of exploitation ? UK? how about those countries also have modern slavery and racism as the modern age. I always wonder why this double standard when it comes to white supremacist? No one is perfect there is always both good and bad in everywhere in the whole world with no exception.

I am not here to supporting Qatar here, I stand against all those trapped people who worked day and time in this slavery system we seeing but in journalism we should be normal and cover all stories without exception not because we are from certain country that does pay us to say something to show the world the other side only. why did not we talk about World cup in another country like Russia or Brazil before ? what if the World Cup was hold in UEA or Saudi would those white supremacists still talk negatively about them in the same way that is happening now ? of course they would because the are Hypocrites",2022-11-21T06:36:24Z,0

"Well imagine this. A foreigner heard people speaking badly about your home. They get curious, so they go to see for themselves. You are already under fire and see changes already being made, yet still everywhere you go people are judging, mocking and some start to spread horrible rumors about your home that people will easy buy now because of what happened. So again, another foreigner comes to see the place isn't perfect like the rest of the world and instead of trying to see the other side, try looking for how it has come to this, why the one in charge isn't doing anything and how they can move forward and change things, they start making fun of your home and then proceeding to publicly pass judgment and criticism to you without knowing a single thing about the place, not laws, culture, tradition, religion, economy, internal politics, society, nothing. His approach is causing more harm than good. Yes, he's getting a lot of people's attention. However, he's getting the wrong people attention who will forget this once the football world cup is over and so will he.  The people who could've done something became defense instead of listening as they felt attacked by him demanding justice. A foreigner, wanting to bring justice to your home that he just sees as so down awful and evil (the place you grew up in and love). When he could've reached out to locals, understood the difficulty of removing the kafala system and helped locals who wants change and can bring change into more light so this matter can reach their government to improve things. Many locals in the Arabian gulf want change, they want the kafala system to stop, they hate who ruined their country because of the kafala system that exploits people. Also, if the matter was so simple, then the cycle of removing it and reintroducing it wouldn't have been a thing.

people beeing promised paid jobs in these rich countries and getting exploited, even for their lives (they just get new ones that are not broken/ (yes:) broken people you just toss aside)

most western(ised) countries and their citicens in the length of that are GUILTY of some form of (mild?) slavery..... we all know where our apple phones are beeing made and aproxamately under what circumstances, no?
...this goes for a whooooooooooooooooooooole range of products, not just our phones, clothes and food. people tend to shut off for things like this (they fixed it, no? >>>> NO, they didn't!)
media... well what is called the main stream media tells these stories from time to time and somewhat later we hear that there are new regulations and stuff, but in reality harldly anything has actually been done. basically it's just a voice to the public like ""sush.. go back to sleep, it's all gonna be all right"".

For reasons like this... I've stopped living about 14-15 years ago and I don't see me pick it up again. I love life, I love inspiration and I wish it for everyone (exept people in advertisement and male-cattle-dung like that).
The size of the pile has become just too damn large and to distinguage between something acceptable and not has been blurred way too much. We've been beaten with bad news now for decades; from war to draught and starvation to enviromental mishaps, companies screwing us over, etc etc, the list goes on (and the LIST goes on.... and on... and on). So to protect our own personal sanity we shut ourselves off of it all: people see the news, but they hardly SEE the news, what it actually means, what the essence of the story entails.

Because of that pushing the the far reaches of our mind of these bad, bad reports people slowly get stressed, panic, get mental and by the help they get from professionals they get to hear that it might be something like an early youthtrauma or stress from work, tentions from the family.. but never: ""yes, this world is not going to poop, it already has"".
Many, many, many people still try to keep up their mask of that they're so happy and fullfilled with all their new shiny stuff, ""succes in life"" and happy photo's, but... in many cases they're quite unhappy and sometimes even quite... dead inside.

One last thing then.... we in the west prize ourself RICH. Clean water, sewer system, electricity, dentists, internet, supermarkets, nice car.. eeeeverything no? but when i see in documentaries people from poor regions of our planet, though they can still manige...... shine with inner happyness, I also see the poverties of the western spirit.
And no.. I do not mean every person, but in general. There IS a big gap people, there IS somethign we just..... lost.

Thank you for beeing patient and reading it all, have a great day :)",2022-11-21T06:20:16Z,0
"Unfortunately people dont seem to have any idea on how hundreds of millions of people live in the world. Qatar and the world cup didnt create this situation, these poor people have no choice but to leave their families and take up any work they can. Focusing on Qatar is not fair, many countries have bad living conditions as a result of colonialist depletion of their resources, and no reperations were made to these countries. Yes, it is bad to get those poor people to work for low wages, but this is part of the current world order, western companies benefit and are a partners in the profits generated from those regions. This issue is being taken from a very racist point of view, if the west wants change, they should press on their democratically elected officials to take concrete steps in not dealing with countries that have practices below their standards. These conditions exist and will continue to exist, within the gulf and outside of it, real change comes from addressing the real problem, not just pointing out one symptom that you dont like.

Lets talk about uk how it is the second largest arms dealer in the world, how they colonised and stole from more than half of the planet. According to amnest refugee and migrant rights are routinely voilated in uk.

Only for them to be made into modern day slaves, who are not payed on time, whose passports are confiscated so that they can never 'escape' back home, are provided with subpar living conditions and working conditions, etc. Sad to see so many people from the Gulf not only defending this abhorrent practice, but also saying 'Why do they come here? That must mean the subcontinent is even worse' as a response to this. Your attitude does not grant you any human rights or religious points, by the way.

Having an industrial area for bachelor laborers makes sense, do you think it’s a good idea for families to live next to these men? Ask me, I am someone who had my ass grabbed by one of the laborers in broad daylight as I was in the wrong area, sure they are not all the same but it is safe to say most of these men don’t know how to act around women and children! Sure they are less privileged and some contractors are evil, but most of them have a better gotten a better life here, it’s just sometimes there are bad eggs in the system, speak about this when your own country is free of human trafficking! In my eyes, Qatar have done it’s best to uplift the lives of those who live here, there’s even a law for laborers transportation to be air conditioned and there are labor laws, you’re also forgetting that these men came from countries that have loose welfare systems, their countries play a part in protecting them too.

- There is an industrial area where the migrant workers live that is away from the main city.
- They recruit labour from neighbouring countries and despite being multi-billionaires spend as little as possible on their working conditions/wages, even charging them to work.

"@(cosmos) No, India only had an Instrument of Accession which limited them to only access the Kashmir valley, and not to ever claim the valley as a part of its own, as was promised by India too. And in a democracy, as the United Nations has declared, that the final resolution to the Kashmir conflict would be for the indigenous Kashmiris to decide their own fate through a fair plebiscite, without changing the demographic of the state, otherwise it wouldn't be recognised! Which is why the majority of the Kashmir valley voted in favour of the Muslim United Front in 1987 to declare themselves as an independent & free state---from Indian occupation, but India tampered with the election, while continuing its brutal & illegal Indian occupation of Kashmir, which is recognised as one of the worst human-rights atrocities in the world by the United Nations! Hence, Kashmir has since officially been recognised as a disputed territory. 🕊️""Azaadi""",2022-11-21T10:43:48Z,
@Ohrdak but the king who owned the land of Kashmir had given permision to me the part of India when pakistani started to invade kashmir so it's not about the people now and most of the Kashmiri people have no problem with that and what opinion will u take from the people who don't belong to kashmir anymore after 1990s.,2022-11-21T07:49:03Z,

"These conditions are not very different from the rest of the gcc countries. I lived in Kuwait from 2016-2020. Conditions there are equal to what's seen in Qatar or worse. I was in Oman as a kid when my parents worked there. Everything you showed about Qatar existed back then in Oman too. There are a lot of good movies that show the conditions of migrant workers in the middle east. A malayalam movie Gadama is a good one. The effort you have taken to show these are much appreciated. Amidst the glitz and blings that blind you in the middle east so many people are suffering there under inhumane working conditions and laws. Ideally countries that preach about human rights should have boycotted this world cup. Even celebrities who supported this and took part in this should have declined. But money rules the world. Qatar is no different from China hosting Olympics and Russia hosting global sports nor the western coutries that protect this Qatar government and society. Everyone went and played there everyone voiced their concerns about human rights conditions there... And the world kept going round and round... :/
There is another aspect to this... I am from Kerala India who lives in the states now. About 36 percent Kerala's gdp is made up of foreign remittances. A majority of this comes from the middle east. Unemployment at home drives people to work in these conditions. Many people in Kerala have comfortable lives because of the abuses their loved ones endured in the middle east. While Qatar should be held accountable for how migrant laborers are treated, governments in India and other places should be held accountable for abysmal unemployment rates and economic opportunities. Despite all these horror stories the fact that the governments from India Nepal etc have not negotiated better working conditions for their citizens should be pointed. Infact if you dig deeper those companies that defrauded those employees are most likely run by migrants from India Bangladesh etc.",2022-11-21T05:17:53Z,18

i can also confirm that racism stems from ignorance and lack of education....which is prominent in the gulf too, ignorant people barely educated and yet egoistic. what a shame. most hospitals in the gulf have a foreign medical staff which shows you how incompetent their countries are in educating their own people.",2022-11-21T05:08:10Z,0

The kafala system actually works in all gulf countries. The employees are usually at the mercy of the employers. It is a system that replaced slavery. Its basically a better version of slavery. Some gulf countries take it a notch higher by making it a requirement that an employer can take an employee's organ like kidney or something incase they need it.

"I totally appreciate your content, the way you bring forward the harsh reality hidden under the guise of shiny surfaces of lies and brutalities. But my one question to you. What's the use of it? We have been hearing such stories of lies, corruption and brutalities on poor people for over decades or centuries now... What we as sane human beings can only do is sympathize with them, bring their stories forward... But only to end up with higher governing authorities to suppress them altogether one day. Be it the organizing authorities backed by governments, or be it the employers indirectly backed by the governments who are meant to protect their rights. Then where do we expect this justice to be served? What we as genuine beings can do is only bring their plight forward or sympathize with them. You are totally a courageous person who go beyond the limits and call spade a spade, but again my question is what's the use of it? I know I am wrong myself here too, for I can't do anything but just ask. But who in real life would can we expect the justice to be served from? UN? Human Rights Councils? Or The corrupt governments leading the UN bodies themselves? It's a vicious cycle, which I guess we can only be saved with due diligence on our part only.

"I'm Indian and I went through Hamad International Airport in Qatar once while traveling to the US. Their airport has been built well, BUT I FOUND THE EMPLOYEES TO BE VERY RUDE AND ARROGANT!! One of them threw my body spray into the bin while saying ""Sorry sir, this isn't allowed on the plane"" before I said ""yes"" (Of course, I said ""okay"" but he had already trashed it by then like he was in control of me and my stuff). Then, there was another lady next to him who just rudely pushed the tray with my stuff far from me while I was next to the tray and putting my stuff back into my bag after my bag had gone through the scanning belt. It almost made my stuff (expensive electronics) fall and break. I never said anything out there, but I'm sure they'd be treating the workers worse if they were being so rude to a paying passenger.

If we only knew the oppression of Qatar toward the little people would we still attended the  world cup. All the attendees to the world cup have now participated in in this abuse. Nice Going all you world cup attendees You people must feel so good today But again you folks will be forgiven because of your ignorance(Qatar is smilling over your IGNORANCE ECHO ECHO).  Why is it that governments do not understand that if one wants to make oneself a good image is simply be loyal to the smalless people you can find in ones Country. Qatar try to save the face but this abuse against the small people is against us all. Yes who wants to trust there direction now? They now lost the face.

"I was working as an Electrical Engineer in Qatar - I can tell you Qatar is a trap not just for labourers but also white coller workers. I finished my graduation and then received an offer from Qatar to work there - Salary offer was 5000QAR which is better than what normally I will get in India as a fresh graduate. Once I went there I understood that the company have put a lock on my visa, I cant travel back to India without their permission called exit permit. They were not paying me salaries, they pay salary with a 2-3 months delay! We cant question them, they will create some bogus case and send workers who question to Jail where we get no fair trial. We cant change jobs even if the government says otherwise. I finally quit my job and am back in India. I got a decent job with a good salary and atleast I am getting paid nowadays. Qatar is a trap guys dont go there - it is a bunch of cheaters and the government is just mere watchers of this cruelty",2022-11-21T03:58:11Z,1

The biggest culprits are Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Malaysia too wasn't far behind.

Bro this is nothing but western hypocrisy.  The west (Europe and America ) is fucking full of shit. They need to own up to their own horrible past instead of pointing fingers.

Many can't take it anymore and simply jump off the building or commit suicide and those who are vocal, are either sent back or are never seen again.

The countries, where these workers come from, have no say, as they have no power.

"Throughout the whole video, the word “coolie” keeps coming up in my mind. The forced labor/slaves you talk about here is no different from the coolies worked from the 17th to 19th century in European colonies in the Americas, such as Peru, Cuba, Costa Rica, Mexico, US, etc. 

Coolies usually worked in cotton or sugar plantations, or on the US transcontinental railroad. The timing of coolie system’s emergence was interestingly right after African slavery’s abolition. Cheap labor is always needed, if not under raw slavery, then it’s under sugarcoated unfair “contract” signed between coolies and their “employers”. 

Similar to the “recruitment fee” the foreign labor has to pay to work in Qatar now, coolies a hundred years ago were loaned money from the farm owners, and had to keep working on a fixed salary before the loan was paid off, and their freedom to travel freely in the country earned. This means the coolies sold themselves to the the farm owners when they provided labor. 

Exploitation never ends. Slavery, coolie, forced labor, industrial zone workers…. Just a name change, and we thought it only existed in history.",2022-11-21T03:06:56Z,0

the story about qatar, the workers, and the world cup is secondary. there’s no clearer evidence of this than the fact that johnny doesn’t actually start talking about conditions in qatar until 18 minutes into the video! that’s nearly 2/3rds of the way in. most everything to that point is about johnny’s struggle to get inside. to go himself. to find someone on the inside. etc. he spends as much time talking about himself (if not more) as he does concerned with the workers and what they face.

Our government is made up of shit people so even our country hasn't done anything to protect its citizens. 
We rely on remittance money so even the government supports young citizens wasting life abroad unless it benefits them.

"This video is very much exaggerated⚠️

I have been a Johnny Harris subscriber for a long time and I have been watching all of your videos as soon as they come out. Most of the time i'm waiting for your uploads. Good work.

But I have somethings to say about this video. I have been living in Qatar for 20 years (and i'm not a Qatari). Lot of things in this video are exaggerated and some are wrong. Like, I have been to industrial area a lot of time, and it's not a 'restricted' place. Yes, it's seperated from town, and it does not have the luxury of the town and the worker work in difficult conditions, but where in the world does construction workers work in a/c. The stadium and some outdoor places are air conditioned, but how can a construction site be air conditioned. It's not just hot in Qatar, the whole Arabia is hot, and all construction workers in the Arab work in the hot weather. How did Dubai construct the whole city? Do you think Emiratis build Dubai and Abudhabi? No, it's the Indians, Bangalese and Nepalese. 

I'm not justifiying. Just saying that, just because Qatar is getting a lot of attention these days, lots of criticism is obviously expected. Especially when it's a small Islamic country with such huge wealth. More workers have died building stadiums in Brazil than in Qatar, and no one ever talked about that.

The Doha metro map that Johnny showed is wrong⚠️. I don't know where Johnny got that map from. But the gold line, which Johnny said was ""never build"" was actually the second line to open to the public, right after the red line. I know because I have travelled in that.

And bachelors are allowed in to reside in the city, and many do. It's just that most construction companies provide residence in the industrial area. It's true that bachelors are not allowed in the family area, but the whole Doha city is not family residence. Again, I know because I have been there and I have seen.

I agree that the gap between the luxury of the citizens and the worker conditions is one of the most in the world. But it's the same in all rich countries. A lot of people from Indian Subcontinent work here in Qatar and most of them are happy.",2022-11-21T01:34:47Z,0

"This would have been a huge soft power win if Qatar actually pay the workers more and not segregate them. Qatar can afford it too. When workers return home, they would be singing praises and be herald as hero bringing back lots of money for their families. Depending on how well they are treated, the non-Muslim might even want to convert. After the World Cup, they might even open up a huge market for voluntary work migration for less intensive jobs. 
Look at Singapore and Hong Kong, there are still lots of issues with these system, but maid and other workers from poorer area go to those places, work, send money back, can call back home any time, return during holidays or major events, and jump right back to work afterward and many clamor for chances to go work at those cities.

"I admire Qatar for deciding they don't want multiculturalism, or to turn their country into a beacon of hope for foreigners to come set down roots, make new lives and get on the pathway to welfare citizenship. They want this labour to be contained and segregated from their population where they could cause social instability and endanger citizens, or god forbid, assimulate. They need labour, not a new identity. It's Consistent with their recent tribal history; simple and clean, and easy to understand (for me atleast). Living conditions should be better and working conditions too, though labour in so much dry heat, will never be pleasant...I live close to the equator, and a walk to the shop on my curb is enough to get soaked with sweat. Always pay though, I'm not for slaving. But I don't share that gut reaction of being appalled that a rich country with a strong currency, rapid development and small native population, should segregate migrant workers, ensure they work on short contracts, and get out once they're done. I have no wish to see Qatari marginalized in their own country, or diversitied into irrelevance.",2022-11-21T00:52:11Z,0

"Journalism, just pure journalism. Johnny didn't have to tell us what to think, just the facts, and how he got the facts.

This is sadly a common practice globally. There are more slaves today than ever have exisited in history, and it makes sense given that we've reached 8 billion people now. People need to know this, and not deny it or turn away from it.

Sports seems to be an easy means of pointing it out too, as Xinjiang forced labor camps make products for companies, like Nike, and then in turn get NBA sponsorships.

I had a layover in Dubai a few years ago, decided to visit the city for a few hours.

Asked again, much more insisting and they let me in. Then I understood why I was sent away, what I saw was hundreds of workers lying on the floors, absolutely miserable. Only then I understood what was going on. They were simply slaves suffering through their fate.

Yelling at the workers, scolding them, some even hitting them. This is also the case in many developed countries. Even Japan is taking this to the next level.

I've seen downtowns in our own United States that are way more delapidated, drug infested and isolated than the Doha industrial area... and no one give a $#!t... infact, those folks are treated like lepers by our own countrymen . You also forgot the counterpoint interviews with some of the Qatari ""accusees"" to hear what they have to say. Even if unscrupulous contractoes used these workers (which is entirely possible by the way), they still have a right to be heard. When someone borrows six moths wages just to pay a recruiter, then signs a contract in a language they can't read, I can't call them entirely blameless. Yes, that doesn't give others the right to take advantage of them, but they're not without blame. Right here in the US every year, we mistreat Mexican migrants almost as badly, then deport them after stripping them of their children... so unfortunately it's a global disease of greed, apparently.

"Long ago when Europeans were very religious, they were prone to narcissism because the education system promoted the idea that you couldn't criticize the church, question religion. You still see that among some Bible Belt type Christians in the South, though not the majority in the US and much less in Canada and Europe. However, in the Middle East, the education system teaches them that the religion is the best, they must be full of cultural pride. Too many people over there in the Middle East are in denial about Qatar, and they don't want to see. Now if so many of those workers were from Egypt, and they were dying in large numbers, things would be different. Those young guys dying are from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan i.e. from South Asia and also places like Kenya. The US does have racism no doubt, but you don't have so many dying because they're exploited at work and ending up with heart attacks, strokes and having their documents confiscated.",2022-11-21T07:21:52Z,

—created by their relatives who work for the government of Nepal—in order to conceal felonies in other countries. Report finally that their Tibetan Abbot and monk relatives collude with it. Report that they rampantly use a U.S. Marriage Visa loophole legal RAPE law called “Required Consummation” — which is the very 1st box that these Tibetan-Nepali thug crime syndicates immediately check off in order to rampantly steal fraud marriage Visas from Americans. Report finally that the U.S. colludes w/ trafficking their own U.S. female citizens via their legal marriage Visa petition RAPE law and non-stop marriage fraud petition fees of RAPED U.S. females.  Report that after the ruthlessly criminal Visas are stolen, that these same Tibetan-Nepali rapists then criminally bring over an adultery bigemy wife and bastard children using the rape-extorted fraud marriage Visa from the raped & pillaged American females. Report THAT for once instead of baiting the public to be targeted over and over again by these Tibetan-Nepali criminal THUGS who pretend to be holy Buddhists.  Their culture subscribes to forced marriages which means systemic cultural RAPE. They initially beg Americans for help that their family member is in the hospital.

Efficiency.

Is there a community or something where you engage with your followers? I remember you said that somewhere.

"To put it simply in 2017, there was a Saudi-led blockade against Qatar. Saudi Arabia and the UAE (secretly supported by the USA) were upset that Qatar was starting to go a bit rogue. Qatar was moving closer to Iran and away from Western influence and of course that’s a big no no in the region. They announced that they would be cutting all ties with each other, even economically, and the excuse was that Qatar was supporting terrorism (which is a lie because Saudi and the UAE also supports terrorism haha). So both sides started going absolutely haywire with the propaganda. The Emiratis payed over 700k to PR firms to publish bad stories about Qatar, the Saudis and the UAE also filed a complaint to FIFA against Qatar to cancel the World Cup there. Qatar owns Al Jazeera and so naturally they also started airing negative stories about Saudi and the UAE. If you remember the hysteria about Jamal Khashoggi you can see that they also succeeded in damaging Saudi’s reputation. The blockade only ended last year and even though they’re pretending to be friendly with each other, there is still no Saudi ambassador in Qatar and relations are still strained. Basically, this controversy surrounding the World Cup is a remnant of the Gulf crisis/blockade. Of course this doesn’t mean it’s a lie. Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by MBS and Qatar treats is works poorly, there’s no denying any of this, but it’s still a PR battle.",2022-11-20T23:45:31Z,

Actually, I can't think of a single civilization that got as far as they did without a massive (and cheap) workforce at their disposal. People think slavery has been abolished... it hasn't. It just evolved and acquired new names, labels and definitions to please modern sensibilities and give people the illusion society has moved on from ""outdated"" customs.

"This isn't just Qatar and it isn't just for the World Cup.  This story is repeated all over the Arabian peninsula, and has been going on for decades.  It is the norm, those countries are using oil wealth to make a life of luxury for their citizens while using and abusing people from poor countries wherever they can. 

I haven't had direct contact, I work with the white collar people who run industry in several of those countries.  The vast majority of the engineers and managers are from India.  The citizens of these countries don't do _anything_, the work is done by imported labor.  Everything from the bottom to the top.  The white collar workers live a comfortable life there, better than they have in India.    From these white collar workers, mostly engineers, I've heard plenty of stories just like this one.  Companies from all over are getting contracts to supply workers.  Those contracting companies may be OK, but many are crossing the line into slavery.  Since the governments of these countries will do little oversight so long as Islamic sensibilities are not offended, the bad companies get away with it.",2022-11-20T22:22:15Z,0

"@Fahed Farouki The trick is probably to try to find a way to phrase things were it's difficult fot nefarious forces to misconstrue what we say by using soundbites. Russel Brand does a good job doing that when he talks about MRNA vaccines. Also the focus should be on using they're own logic against them, with a heavy emphasis of soundbites and quotes from their camp contradicting either their own statements or the statements of people on the ground. It's difficult for people to attack your statements when you didn't actually say anything, after all it's them saying. When we can use nothing but quotes to express our points thrn that's a good script. 

Going even further, we can define ourselves in terms they identify with and call ourselves the real ones and them the fake. Rightwingers especially would fall for this trick. For example, I can say, 'If Zoinism just means historically persecuted Jews have the right to find refuge in a land that had no previous population, then I'm a Zionist. Isreal is an invasionary terrorist force that uses fake Zionism as a cover'. 

It's really hard to call someone an anti-semite when you just called yourself a Zionist, even though you obviously changed thr definition to suit you. That's because i. reality all these so-called acedemics who pretend to very clever are actually all about image. They can be taken down by people who also prioritise curating the image of what they say! And it doesn't necessarily require compromising the truth, if anything it could enhance it as we try to describe what we mean in terms they will more clearly understand. I don't have anything against Jews or Judaism itself, I like some parts of Judaism, just not the Anti-Christianity parts, just like I like some parts of Islam apart from the Anti-Judaism parts, and I like some parts of Christianity.",2022-11-20T23:08:33Z,

These people are workers, you can’t expect some Airconditioned cushy office otherwise nothing would’ve been built ever. Secondly, all things considered, their work conditions aren’t so bad either. They have a helmet, metal-toe boots and other general safety equipment which frankly other countries (I’m from India, TRUST ME I KNOW) do not provide or care for whatsoever. Yes, the housing is terrible but there are workers in other countries who are made to sleep in fields or on the roads so Qatar wins there as well no matter how terrible the housing is and lastly, I’d like to see how the US and other western countries treat Indian and Bangladesh workers. They seclude and isolate them even more. The point that I’m trying to make here is that this documentary is solely trying to make rich Qataris look bad as there is such a difference in wealth. Yes, taking their passports and not paying them on time is horrible and I agree on the ‘slavery’ aspect of it but at the end of the day, they are workers, their JOB IS GOING TO BE HARD LABOR which they Literally signed up for.",2022-11-20T22:15:38Z,0

I admire bold people like you. All humanitarian should join to stop evil acts on human.,2022-11-20T22:08:56Z,0

All these people from the indian subcontinent complaining about the working condition should just stay in their countires and try to work there. I am not defending the gulf countries but they give oppotunities to many migrant workers. Something the western countries dont do. I do not see the western countries giving employment to any third world countries all they do is exploit them.,2022-11-20T22:08:32Z,0

"Seeing how many people in the comment who have been personally affected by this chills me. It is absolutely heartbreaking. This discussion has been going on for almost half of my life, and purely because of where I was born, I am not in a position where I was forced to go to these slave camps to provide for my family. I have had a hard time taking a stance on this, as the consequences for the workers were to unfathomable for me to even begin to understand. But after this I am definitely not going to give this World Cup even the slightest of “fan” attention. All that matters is that justice for these poor people will be served and the families’ losses won’t go unnoticed by the world.",2022-11-20T22:08:12Z,0

"OMG this is so embarrassing Johnny, “Qatar Trap “ this just makes me cringe. industrial area is a spot where you find garages, factories etc and plus when the workers arrive it just depends on how they choose to keep the place sanitised so if they place is dirty you cannot blame the company plus they can  whenever they want to they can return to their home country. When companys dont pay workers thats a company problem not a country problems they can always talk to the law about that. about workers dying you know its a very hazardous job and there are consequences take a look at how many wokers died in Brazil, South Africa when they were building/ refurbishing the world cup stadiums nobody talked about that and on top of all the lies that i heard workers paying 1k to 4k dollars in order to come thats just ridiculous, the company are paying for everything even for their tickets when you said they borrow from their relatives it just shows how obsessed you are in ruining the reputation of a country that you never been too.",2022-11-20T22:07:25Z,0
HMMM pretending that you don't know what the blue zoned area is for when this has been reported on by others already a long time b4 you then taking that and acting like you discovered something that only you are reporting on seems low to me. like a way to make it seem to the less educated of your followers that you are a real hero of sorts for discovering this and reporting on it.. When in fact if you as someone that I guess makes a living on reporting things to other would have to admit that if this is not the case then you are incredibly ignorant and have been living under a rock for the past 12 years since this started happening.

You're not allowed to stay out of accommodation in between 4am and 7am, you have minimum rest (you're not allowed to go out of the hotel/accommodation 12 hours prior to your pick up time). They never follow the rule of flying hours per month (if they need to make you fly exceeding hours and for you to be ""legal"" - they will). You're not allowed to have visitors who are not Qatar airways employees or don't hold Qatari ID (it's been forbidden to stay in a hotel with your parents/close relatives if they visit you in Doha, and they're forbidden to come see your place). If you want to get married you have to ask the company first, if you want to live with your spouse - you have to ask for a permission (mostly they decline; allow only for crew). To leave the country for vacation - you have to ask permission from the ministry of foreign affairs (mostly 24 hours before your planned trip). And much more

People were praising Qatar for over a decade for their being a very tolerant country in the middle east but why did their opinion change all of a sudden when they are hosting a sports event they so much prepared for 12 years. The facts were all right there since day one and nobody ever raised objections or they were too sheepish to be silence or paid off. These middle eastern countries with their over developed cities cannot be built over night on the backbones of immigrant workers without basic human rights. There's are Qatari babies born in Qatar with a welfare check and the right to exploit foreign works so they and their haram family can live like kings by the sweat and tears of foreign immigrants.

"Johnny, As I googled the map of the industrial area I could find hospitals, mosques, government buildings, supermarkets, and factories even the air force has a base there. If you go to UAE or any Arab country there are industrial areas that are separated from the residential area, it's zoning. Simple!

Residential areas should be like that even in my country Indian city of Kochi has an industrial area separated from residential nothing wrong with that. The kafala system is corrupted and many companies in India and Qatar trap people by that loophole it is right and both parties have dirty hands in that. You can apply directly also from Qatar visa centers without any upfront money same as you get a US visa.

Qatar can't be blamed as a whole for that or any other country because our countries do have not that much work here. My state of Kerala is entirely dependent on remittance from these countries and migrant workers there some have the luxury or moderate and others have poor living conditions you can't explain that in any series of videos. The impact of that kind of money is huge. 

As you have said in your previous video Qatar got the world cup using the power of money and influence the other party also helped as in the case of the French government. Answer this johnny if an Arab country has all the money and means to host such an event and the west doesn't comply because of the hypocrisy they have with Islam and third-world countries it's the only way they can do that. The so-called civilized west doesn't like the middle east and whole Asian countries that's a fact and nowadays media is in a frenzy criticizing of  Russian War, China dependency, India buying oil from Russia yet Europe buys it and Saudi aligning with Russia through opec+ the truth is west is afraid. Why should we listen to you?

Why are you not posting a video about why the US invasion of Afghanistan halted a country's progress yet you are sanctioning them and not letting them build themselves at least now they are ruling themselves not some random culture-less global police and why sanction Iran and Venezuela not entering the oil market so that you can have control. It's all double standards man!!!

And as I am a follower of your work in independent journalism and appreciate that now I am having a doubt that if you are a part of propaganda.

So to sum it up, VERY SERIOUS human rights violations are occurring in these golf countries and will continue to occur because frankly, they got what the world needs, and until that changes they will continue with their unethical practices.

But can we please get back to the question at hand? You raise interesting points, but you’re dodging my primary question about how you would do it if you were the man in charge of Qatar. Should an employer pay more than the market dictates because they can afford it?

"@William Chamberlain I actually like your response, and I feel like I would enjoy you as a debate partner. However…you still didn’t answer my question. How would you do it differently? Should employers pay employees more than necessary solely because they can afford it? 

I’m currently in the Dominican Republic, where the locals import cheap labor from Haiti. They pack them into these big trucks and put them to work in extremely hot temperatures. 

It sucks and I wouldn’t want to do that type of work for that type of money, but these Haitians leave home for this opportunity and it allows them to send money home to support their families. No matter how crappy the job is, it’s still an upgrade to finding work in Haiti. 

It’s easy to crap on something, but it doesn’t mean much unless you pose a better solution. Do you support free market dynamics? Capitalism?

"@William Chamberlain true, but it kinda reminds me of the joke about the difference between a religion and a cult…about 100 years. 

Nobody seems to care that the pyramids in Egypt, the coliseum in Rome and almost all of these historical treasures were built by slaves. 

If you were the head of Qatar, how would you handle sourcing manual laborers? They already fully subsidize their citizens, so they have no motivation to get their hands dirty. 

Would you propose just paying the visiting laborers more? To me, if someone is willing to come to your country because the income is greater than what they can get back home, that’s just a choice, unlike the other places that I mentioned….that were actually built by slaves without a choice in the matter. 

If you want to disparage the status quo, tell me how you would do it better, hopefully without proposing to spend other peoples’ money.",2022-11-20T22:14:28Z,

"Am an Indian and am currently in qatar, this not the just a qatar story and its happens everywhere if you are  under a agency or under sponsorship, many of the things mentioned here to me like you guys having a personal grudge or some    Miss understanding   towards this small wealthy country. And ill tell you this, qatar not hire or invite anybody to work here with out their salary or their basic needs. If they need to get some jobs done they will put a bid, and if a company place their bid and they think its good for them  they will give approval for the contract and they need to get the job done by the time they mentioned and agreed on the submitted contract.and i think its clear for you.2 think,you need to be aware or the legal issues if the company don’t pay salary to the workers. They can get assistance or support straight from the MOI(ministry of interior) or embassy and they can give you the solution.and if the MOI finds there is a rule violation they will finds the best solution like compensation from the  sponsored company or agency and they will help you to reach your country if you want. The details mentioned above is true and you can correct me if am wrong. So please don’t just drag or just put all blame like qatar is the who is responsible for all of the issues and they all are cruel and bad people. For better understanding please stay here for at least a year and get to know the people,the culture, security and the hospitality they giving with out any colour,nationality,or faith you follow. So please consider these things before just putting all the blames and judgements that created by some so called medias and other articles. The is not to hurt any ones feeling,its only for being loyal to the country that helps to put food on the table and to get better living for many like me. Thank you.",2022-11-20T21:37:35Z,0

My guess is that if they knew everything beforehands (total amount of debt, share of the salary deduced for food and accommodation, etc...), they might found other jobs that have higher take home pay and better conditions.",2022-11-25T13:38:13Z,

"Sorry if I sounded insensitive, but I am puzzled by the 'debt trap', i. e. the recruitment fees the workers have to pay. In most of the jobs that I work, if I have to relocate, I am expecting a sign in bonus or that my employer paid the relocation costs.
In white collar jobs, the employer company will often paid a hefty fee to the recruiting company. I never heard of the worker paying anything (usually the recruiting company cover the interview costs). 
Is it common in India / Nepal / Myanmar that the worker paid a recruiting fee to the recruiting company ? If yes, how does the 'recruiting company' justify it?
Why does the workers accept this system, despite this being a signal that the job has horrible conditions ? I am guessing because the money seems to good to pass on in theory, and lack of information about the reality.",2022-11-20T23:21:42Z,

1. There is so much little information present in this vedio that justifies quatar's act of slavery.

2.  It almost feels like this vedio is made to condemn quatar just because of the dislike of Western world.

3. How many workers die every year in European countries due to the heat and if not heat the people who are classified as ""Family colony"" die because of gunshots just because there is a law which enables the citizens to have a gun in their pocket.

4. Why the fuck aree u not making videos about the role of European countries in proxy wear against Arabs.

5. Its not the country that you have to hate for where they are, u have to hate the system which made the country to be where they are ""#BANFIFA""",2022-11-20T20:26:16Z,0

These workers in Qatar don't visit their countries very often because the ultimate goal of these workers is to save enough money to return to their country and start some business in their own country, and they don't want to spend their money in traveling backforth and ""waste money"".

Qatar is doing shit ton of propaganda in the Arab world to demonize the west for these allegations, and since we have limited access to journalism from the outside along with language barriers, many people just think that these are all ""lies by the west to ruin Arab countries""
I'm Arab myself and I have known about this issue for a long time, and also personally know some of those workers... but most people don't know, and they get nothing but state-owned propaganda from each government or political entity in the region... and since independent journalists get often silenced in middle east.. we NEED reports like this to always at least includes an Arabic subtitle, so people can be informed outside brainwashing bs they're being fed


and it is funny how Qatar is claiming to abide by Islamic rules, yet they ignore most of them because it doesn't bring them money, and just focus on dumb things like alcohol and pork to fool simple-minded people into believing how righteous they are (basically same as the churches in middle age Europe)
- Slavery is extremely haram in Islam, one of Mohamed's first acts when preaching Islam was to abolish slavery
- Vanity and Greed are condoned in all throughout Quran
- even though alcohol is haram, it says you are not allowed to drink it or distribute it, nothing says about banning others... and the hypocrisy is that they have no problem distributing alcohol in many of their state-owned businesses (like Qatar Airways) ""we will sell it to you but we won't let you drink it""
- as for other rights and everything else even if it's ""haram"" and practiced by non Muslims, there's a very clear verse in Quran that basically says to ""live and let live"", but that is ignored by ALL dictators and warlords.. because it doesn't benefit their agendas",2022-11-20T20:10:06Z,0

I truly don't understand the audacity,2022-11-20T22:11:02Z,
"@UCQgrUjJlalwO3Ml_K-77PiA Yes people do criticize the west and it is allowed because we value freedom of speech and democracy. These things don't exist in most of the Middle East. That's how we build institutions that are strong and resilient to corruption, which is hilarious considering you are Egyptian, living a country that depends enormously on Western direct foreign aid amounting to billions of $ each year, military dictatorship and one of the most corrupt country in the world.

For example, if I was going to make publicly a critical statement in Egypt on how let's say the military dictatorship in Egypt is embezzling public funds to build their brand new palace (e.i. the octogon), I might get arrested on dubious charges.

Yet, people like you fall all the time into the fallacy of blaming others for you problems. I would argue in fact that YOU and your fellow citizens should take action to make your country a better place, it shouldn't be indeed our responsibility, but you guys are unable to, so you flee to the west.

So yes, you are very contradictory and hypocritical that you are using a Western Platform that operates on free speech laws/values to label westerners as just hypocrites for exposing something real, while you defend censorship on any critical thinking on other countries like yours that doesn't have that luxury. Your argument just don't make any sense, I just think your feelings are hurt for whatever reason.",2022-11-20T21:27:08Z,

You know, every state practiced slavery, imperialism at some point, including Egyptians. Did you forget history by any chance? The Muslim arabs were the very first to start the slave trade on scale with East Africa because they viewed them as lesser beings. The same is happening today with brown people in these states.

"The hefty recruitment fee is very common everywhere in the world for foreign workers, even in places with better wage and working conditions. It's usually the local agents looking to make profit, because the rich countries or companies needing those labor don't actually want to make it hard for cheap labor to come. There's a documentary from BBC about seasonal Indonesian plantation workers in the UK and the company said it's also a problem for them and they would like to eliminate it, and they offer returning workers to work directly for them so they don't have to pay the agents. Their wage for the first season there is basically used to pay back the debt, and then they return the next year to earn actual money.",2022-11-20T19:59:53Z,0

We mexican believed that it ended up with something we know as The Tlatelolco Massacre, and we couldn't be more wrong  The Tlatelolco Massacre was just the beginning of a huge revolution that was warming up, but it was suffocated by Echeverría, the enxt president.

"Would it be unreasonable to think that the World Cup organizers should to some degree be held responsible for choosing a country where these kinds of labour abuses have been well-known for a fairly long time? I'm not even a highly informed person, but I've heard of this kind of thing happening to support the construction of cities like Doha and Dubai for years, and let's face it, the governments of the Arabian peninsula (among other places, yes) have never shied away from using slavery and exploiting severely disadvantaged workers to fuel their obscene wealth. This is well known, and yet the World Cup has chosen to condone and perpetuate these abuses through its decision to let Qatar host the games. I believe they have blood on their hands. I also think boycotting the games would be a reasonable gesture for sports fans to make, but I wouldn't expect that.

A final point: I know this is far from the only problematic development project tied to big sports. I live near Vancouver, and remember when the Olympics came to the city, they shipped a huge amount of the homeless people (with one-way tickets) over to Vancouver Island so that the tourists coming to enjoy the games wouldn't have to suffer through seeing the ""filth"" living on the streets. No country is beyond reproach.",2022-11-20T19:51:15Z,1

"The zoning thing is not unreasonable. I mean let's try to see things from a different perspective: university towns that attract lots of foreign students, for example, would similiarly zone student mass housing (like dormintory buildings) separately from local residential areas. There are lots of good reasons for doing this - transport infrastructure planning, considerations regarding the distribution of essential services etc.  

More importantly are the demographic considerations: this video is framing the zoning as a racist thing, but anyone who's being honest will admit that an influx of many single men (and I mean single as in they might be married back home but don't have any partners locally) is likely to cause an increase in certain types of economic activity, including vice (alcohol consumption, visiting prostitutes, etc). Any responsible government will want to limit the potential spillover of such activities into existing residential areas where family units reside. Do this type of zoning in, say, an American mining town where the workers are Americans from other states and nobody would bat an eyelid. 

I won't defend the witholding of pay and curbs on free movement though, those are definitely dehumanizing.",2022-11-20T19:47:55Z,2
"@Pratham Sharma Yes, but firstly illegal doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I'd bet there's a sizeable black market of alcohol and sexual services in Qatar - these things exist in many gulf countries. 

Secondly even if the presence of alcohol and prostitution is small initially, there's the likelihood that they will increase as the demand for them increase together due to the influx of bachelors. Zoning the workers close together makes logistical sense for this reason.",2022-11-20T19:59:56Z,

"For a system in the western media which calls out countries like India on human rights, it always intrigued me how come modern-day slavery in the rich oil wealthy countries in the middle east always seems to miss their eyes. I am sure it is a co-incidence :)

For a media machinery that has humiliated India for 80% of Indians' religious beliefs leading to regional beef bans (which are still portrayed by this system as national), there seem to be no major setbacks for countries with less than 20% of the population being actual citizens that enforce the religious beliefs that barely allow any women's rights, ban alcohol for everyone including foreigners in the world cup, and execute secret missions on killing journalists on foreign lands, in addition to what we saw in this video. And Al-Jazeera has literally done it all, and defended all the hypocritical restrictions and is still hailed as a reliable news source in the west.

As an Indian, I have always known what happens to my fellow Indians in these countries. The Indian government can't do much as foreign currency inflow for a net importer like us and maintaining good relations for oil is more important.

You but forgot one incredibly important aspect of recruiting; I believe that all construction firms have sent dubious folks that have sent other dubious folks and so on to recruit as many folks as possible by creating a subtle entrapment system; 

Personal perspective;
So far, nobody from the middle East understood why such heavy works had to find place during the day & not at evening/night/early morning hours.
The amount of money that was given from the Qatari’s to the construction firms was 10 to 20 times more than any government ever spent on a WC ( of course, host didn’t have a single one ready in 2010 )
I’m sad as Middle East is know for its hospitality but we now are ashamed that such things even happened and so much so on a big scale.

Huge respect for Johnny . I've lived in Kuwait my whole childhood and have seen my dad undergo some sort of racism at work. He worked a white collar job and thus was given basic human respect and after working for 25 years he never got a single promotion where as kuwaiti fat fucks who knew nothing about the job got promoted to be his boss. The world needs to shift away from OIL and gas to more natural sources of energy so that these GULF nations drink and die in their OIL. It's a shame how these nations call themselves islamic yet follow nothing islamic and treat their immigrants worse than rats. This is the modern day Slave trade and FIFA just fuelled it .,2022-11-20T19:39:10Z,0

"Just a general lookout for people commenting, a bunch of trolls (some with burner accounts) trying to play down the journalism at show here.

Also journalism is inherently biased, there's no way you can report on anything ""objectively"" there is always bunch of biases that get into journalism. Qatar has been under scrutiny for long but their condition is the same as every energy resource rich country. They have something others don't and they don't like getting criticized for and it is truly unjustified.

"why werent their wages mentioned? surely theres a reason theyre travelling halfway across the world to work there.. theyre getting paid well to work there compared to wages in their home country.. clearly they werent held captive if the punishment for protesting was just getting deported back to their home..... im not sure what the real issue is, theyre workers hired to do a job, they knew before coming they wouldnt get citizenship, they knew itd be miserably hot, andd that theyd be required to work for long hours at a tough pace

we have very similar here in 1st world countries... not uncommon at all in canada for someone to move to alberta to work 100 hours a week for months on end in blistering cold -40c at times, with foreman yelling when you take too much time to warm up in a truck or work to slow in the cold maybe you hate that person at the time maybe they have a bad approach to their job but ultimately the work has to be done someone has to do it.. if you dont like the climate, the work, the wages youre free to pack up and go home

its called an OPPORTUNITY youre free to pass on it, find other opportunities but im sure you could go out of your way to interview people who really enjoyed their work experience there they made more money then anyone in their home country ever has in the construction industry and theyre better off for their whole life with those funds lifting them up an letting them choose their future path, ive worked 100 hour weeks at a non stop pace both at -40c where you nose freezes shut from the moisture in your breathe.. to being on roof tops when its +35C out and the black shingles are hot enough to burn your skin if you touch them always got the job done, always got paid well.. used those fund to start my own small business and now i work my own hours in my preferred avenue of work and have employees under me.. coincidentally i like construction i still work on sweltering hot roofs in the summer and outside in the fridget  cold of a canadian winter, im not sure when working hard became so villainized

"This is all based on a western propaganda against Qatar for the Islamic laws they are strictly implenenting in this WC. Most of the points this guy made were totally baseless and not even close to reality. Throughout the 30+ minutes video he ranted that Qatar exploited the labourers but failed to explain a single situation where that actually happened. Kept on talking about the strict laws in Qatar and the inaccessibility to the industrial area. But in the later parts of the video we saw that his informer easily made it to the industrial area and captured everything he wanted. 

Plus he ridiculously kept on talking about the tough weather conditions. What has the govt got to do with the climate? Guy literally forgot that the top western countries are the highest ranked in terms of annual carbon emmiters leading to global warming worldwide. Guy kept on crying that Qatari authorities exploited the workers but literally forgot that the workers went there by their own will to earn their livelihood. They weren't kidnapped or abducted. They were paid for the work they did! It was not the first time in history that labourers migrated from different parts of world to middle east for jobs and to earn money. Guy went literally bonkers and never said a single word on what they were paid. Salaries/wages and other stuff.

"This started at 2010. In the years that followed it was already in the newspapers but nobody cared. So now suddenly when the world cup is about to start you quickly point some things out on your screen, but you really don't show anything new at all. Yes, it's very well known tons of migrant workers were hired and lived there under terrible conditions. But why do you think they went over there in the first place? Cause they could make more money and provide for their families. It's simple opportunity. 

Also, it's pretty hypocritical when you look at it from a Western perspective. We do the same thing all the time. We move our production to factories abroad where conditions are very poor. Just look at the amount of people that took their own lives working for Foxconn...well they make our products. Just like we are now complaining about these countries during the environmental summit in Egypt. Now we point the finger at China. But we forget it was us that closed our polluting factories here so we would look good on paper. We literally paid them to open up factories for us there. Our consumerism has a price, but we are not the ones paying it. The world cup is just another example. 

I am not sure if you can solely blame Qatar for this. I mean what did we expect that would happen? They had no facilities whatsoever and yet we decided to hand them the world cup...it was all about money. Qatar needed a lot of workers but they didn't have the organization in place to deal with that in a normal manner. It's such a massive undertaking that every country would have struggled to get this done in time, apart from China maybe. And now we point the finger at them because we never take any responsibility ourselves.

"Your video is absolutely bullshit, you should know that 95% of the employment in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan is bonded, you have to sign 5-10 year-long bonds that are legally enforceable and if you break them, you can go to jail or be forced to pay 100s of thousands of dollars, 

If the living conditions in Qatar were so shit, we wouldn't be flocking there in droves, we do it because the median wage in India is 110 USD nominal (770 USD in PPP), rent, food, healthcare, and electricity are free (rural areas, subsistence farming), however to become rich without having any education, you have to get some 220-330 dollars per month, after that, you will live like a king in any rural area; however, this is impossible in India without becoming a doctor, lawyer, or an engineer, so people usually go to Qatar where they get 300-500 dollars per month with free food and free accommodation (shared beds and shitty food), they then send the money to their family in India, and their children can finally attend a school (most schools in India are private schools, the fees is something like 40-50 dollars per year but many people can't afford them) and your family can live a good life in their village.

These recruiters don't usually recruit people directly and instead have local middlemen doing the actual convincing and hiring, and people actually bribe these middleman to enlist. Even with all the possible abuse and exploitation in a foreign land, you have to understand that the earnings and living conditions are still better than what our poorer class is used to. In local soils, they'd be doing double the work for half the pay anyway.

"I grew up in Dubai and lived there 35 years.

To not notice it happening means that you really were not paying attention or more realistically...you didn't care about it much as long as you were comfortable.

Most people know, and most turn a blind eye.
Some people help when they can, but have to be quite careful not to draw too much attention to these issues.

It's sort of an easy way to end up being jailed or deported and banned for life...or worse.

Let's just say that you are 'encouraged' to keep your mouth shut while you are living and working in those countries. In particular if it's anything that damages the country's image.

It's the same in pretty much every Gulf country really. Some more strict than others...but in general people have the sense not to bite the hand that feeds.

I would also like to add that this is pretty well known in the countries that send labourers to that region.
Philippines, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh etc...those countries know what's up.
The governments of those countries don't really do much to protect the human rights of their citizens either.

At the end of the day, no one is forced to go there and I know several there who were NOT privileged...worked hard for many years and became very successful as a result.

You cannot have a one sided knee jerk reaction to this because you suddenly woke up to what was right under your nose your entire life and you instantly grew a conscience.

Did you honestly think the buildings of Doha grew out of the desert by magic?

I'm not saying it's right and a good way to treat people...but the fact is...they go there because it seems like a better alternative to life in their own country.

I notice India has improved a lot in the last decade or so in many ways at an encouraging pace. Still much more to do...but it's at least heading in a reasonably good direction.

Every data he refers in most of the videos are biased or tilted for some hidden agenda. Kindly don’t fall for this. Take a ticket and visit Qatar. Ask how many jobs has that land provided. Ask many Indians how this country with no income tax had made them rich. And check past world cups and the deaths related to those. You will change your mind.

And the Kafala system makes it even worse.
And the persons who recruit them are deliberately doing it, exploiting them.
Even after all this still, there is still a caveat.
The working conditions in their countries are not good either.
Most of the time even worse.
Unemployment is a big problem in their countries.
So when they get a chance to go to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or any other oil-rich country as a worker, they take that chance.
Because it can improve their family's economic situation drastically.",2022-11-20T19:08:09Z,0

Of course, most people come from abroad, CIS still has too many places where promise of 10 bucks a day can convince people to risk their lives for it.

I wanna add on to this…the last two world cups were conducted in Russia and Brazil….not the ideal nation for this event to be held…they hve had their own issues as well…
Why didn’t the media report all tht?i remember seeing protesters in the streets of Rio during the time of World Cup there…saw it in the news…and…I don’t hve to tell u abt Russia…if someone try to go against Putin…the someone is gone…
I just feel like the western world is too jealous of Qatar money?..lol…I know it’s silly..but I do feel so…I am not saying that Qatari practices are right…they aren’t in any manner…completely aware of tht..but they are getting too much bad image …as if all other previous World Cup locations were heavens…..which they clearly weren’t..

I did have some interesting conversations and banter with the other workers though, most of which were Sri Lankan, Nepalese, and Filipino. 

It was also Ramadan at the time, so it was at the height of summer, meaning it was extremely hot. There was no functioning AC, and I had to sneak away to drink water or smoke a cigarette. Only worked half days though during Ramadan.

"A recent report shows, since Qatar won the bidding main stream news channels including The Guardian started to promote unnecessary allegations against the Qatar government. Boycott Qatar propaganda of western countries should be questioned. The Guardian reported Misinformation against Qatar government stating almost 6500 of them are killed during construction works, but instead of denying deaths, Qatar stated only 40 people died accidentally during the ten year construction projects worth 220 billion dollars. They said, we had mistakes and we will correct them. But the figures of 6500 presented by The Guardian really shows how desperate West is to denounce Qatar. The death rate of 40 people during large construction projects of 10 years is a normal rate. Previous Host russia invaded and killed millions in Chechnya, but nobody said boycott Russia why? Russia never allowed LGBTQ flags in the stadium, still nobody said Don't go to Russia. The matter of the next host is even crazy. The USA is known for illegal arms deals, invasion of a lot of countries and also killed millions of people in the last decade only. Why don't they boycott America?. White supremacist countries of europe and Americas still think they are in colonial era.. They cannot tolerate an Islamic country hosting such a big event in a magnificent manner.

"Probably unpopular opinion but I want my 30 minutes back. This is how it's been in the GCC countries for years so not just World Cup or Qatar specific issue. Yes the way they treat these people are horrible but we should also put the blame on the countries who are not taking measures to inform their own citizens well and what is expecting them overseas.
It is not like Qatari people going overseas to snatch people on the streets or kidnapping them from their beds and making them work at gunpoint. How about making an episode on how much countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal and so on receives money from their citizens working overseas to keep their economy floating or the amount of kick backs officials receive?

Note: looking at the comments, this is not award winning journalism or whatsoever. Everyone who lived there know about these and since most countries have embassies in the region and it'd be foolish to think the World is not aware of this.  I lived in Bahrain as an expat (white collar job) and I knew there will be certain limitations the way I can live my life and did an exhaustive pros-cons list and opted to move there. I condemn human right violations taking place in Qatar or elsewhere but rest of the World is also an accessory to the crime.",2022-11-20T18:57:46Z,0

I personally know many of them who  went there to make a fortune and make a good use of the strong currency of Qatar. The work is  hard,  the conditions and right as workers are worst. But they do get paid better than the local economy. But there are several places like in Saudi and others, they treat migrant workers with relatively good rights. For being one of the LDCs, there are no better options than to work on those harsh conditions. In a way,  the  remittance they send is one of the significant pillars of the country's economy. I do not know why our officials are not looking into this matter for a long term solution.",2022-11-20T18:49:47Z,0
"Talk to anyone that served in the US military, and they will tell you that exploiting outside labor is a tradition in the middle east. The ship I served on saved a slave ship that was heading from Ethiopia to Yemen. In the end, when we returned them to Ethiopia, we are pretty sure they were killed by their own government (a warlord-type system).

Their ship lost its engine and floated out in the Gulf of Aden for days without food or water. Many people onboard died. We got a report of a ship DIW, which is why we responded to help them.",2022-11-20T18:49:44Z,0

"This is pennical of western hypocrisy. There racism against Arabs has been unveiled. The migrant workers you are talking about were living in a dire condition in there countries(where avg salaries might be as low as 20$/Month)Qatar gave them a decent Jobs,these are the people from the most underprivileged areas and mostly didn't even completed junior high school. The hypocrite West always talks about egalitarianism around the world but always discriminate in giving Work visas to the most underprivileged class in South Asian countries. I my self being a South Asian know that no western country has in the last decade given works visa to uneducated workers who cannot afford to get an education. They always give work visa to the most privileged, rich class of the society. Unlike Qatar, which infact hasn't discriminated against the underprivileged people and has given an opportunity to them to make 20 to 30 times the money they would make in their countries. Can anyone please tell me how many Work Visas were issued by the whole EU to underprivileged South Asian in the last decade? I bet it wouldn't be a 2  digit number (Excluding Spouse/dependents of a degree holder). So where is egalitarianism? I cannot understand this hypocrisy. So at one side we have Qatar that has provided the most underprivileged people better lively hood and Hypocrite EU who hasn't given any Work visa to underprivileged workers and then EU starts lecturing Qatar.

P. S I read the Guardian report saying that 6500 workers have died in the decade after 2010 in Qatar working on World cup. 
First off all, my condolences to all the families of those who perished Second of all Fatalities of construction workers is a global phenomenon, just for Context In 2020, 4,764 workers in the United States suffered fatal work injuries. Over that period, the private construction industry accounted for 1,008 deaths, or 21.2 percent of total deaths. In 2019, there were 3408 fatal accidents at work in the EU of which 755 were construction related.

When you exploit people, you don't want to have to relax with your family and watch tv and then have those exploited wander into your vision.

Not only death while  working, but the torture, not paying the workers, leaving those disabled to die and even put on jail for no apparent reasons as well... As kids, we donated as much as we could to organizations and movement who would try and bring those people back... You stop thinking about it after a while as people going there for work won't stop in our country any time soon... But when I heard the total death count had reached almost 1600+ for the people working in stadiums, hotels only, i snapped... As a football fan myself, this is the first time i've felt like not watching the world cup... We don't have any agenda against Qatar. in fact diplomatically Qatar is one of our close allies... they've helped us a lot but still i despise them... for something built on death of so many our close ones... i hope their downfall is even more rapid... this goes without saying but F*ck you Qatar and the Qataris for everything you've done against humanity",2022-11-20T18:38:19Z,2

"Hi Johnny,
I don’t think that people in Qatar are doing anything wrong because the workers who went to work there were already in deep financial difficulties they were already living in the worst situation in their home countries some people might have gotten into wrong hands but not all of them I’ve been in Qatar for 10years worked in different industries people who work there are quite happy they were strong financially.",2022-11-20T18:32:19Z,2
"I’m sorry but this has got to be one of the most naive, insulated and out of touch comments I have read recently and I will call you out on it.

1) You said you worked in several industries over 10 years there in Qatar and you and other expats you have met are happy. Did you start off as a migrant worker who paid a recruitment fee to go to Qatar and had your wages withheld and had to work in 50C and live in crap accommodation? Were any of the happy expats you mentioned being used as labour and being exploited to build infrastructure for the World Cup? The point is there’s no point referencing the happiness of expats who are clearly NOT the migrant workers that this issue is about.

2) I agree (to an extent) the “people of Qatar” are not doing anything “wrong”. But the Qatari Government has set up a system that allows the exploiting and abuse of migrant workers. E.g. “Recruitment fee” to go and work in Qatar, Not paying wages. These are very WRONG!! Qatar has enough money to bribe corrupt FIFA officials in the millions but no money to cover the BS “Recruitment fee” and withholding wages?? That is baffling.

3) Your comment about “workers were already in deep financial difficulties” and “living in the worst situation in their home” insinuates that this gives a free pass for the Qatar government to exploit and abuse migrant workers - is this correct? I’m not sure all were in the most dire of dire situations as you would like to believe either. Those people might not have had the same opportunities to make money as others in their home country so if an opportunity to make money for their families in an HONEST manner comes along, can you blame them for taking it? The difference is they are forced into a system that takes advantage of their situation. Even if they came from dire situations they seen to be better quality human beings than those running the show in Qatar.",2022-11-20T19:42:08Z,

True it felt like a bit much. It takes away from the crux of the story. 10 minutes in and we were still building up to the story. It makes the story feel unrealistic even though it's a very real issue,2022-11-20T19:08:21Z,

"@Awais mahmood First I'm not even European but that's ok, second, I do think in Europe there is this type of over dramatization as well but when I watch American made documentaries/news reporting there is always an excessive amount of drama added.

"@srikanth sarjanaa I'm not saying that the whole video was bad or over dramatized, I just personally feel like the conversation in the beginning were fabricated to give more drama to the story than needed. I've only recently started watching Johnny's videos and I like them all including this one, I just pointed out something in the beginning that a lot of other American media do to create more drama, I always dislike filmed conversations like that because they always seem scripted.

 I agree with your point if you mean that journalists are not covering about west atrocities clearly but that's not the case as there is plethora content showing the bad side.
If you might think that the propagandists are hiding the true side of the west, how do you think you and I know the other side? The same jonny harris you might frame him for propaganda also made videos that are critical to USA history.",2022-11-21T12:34:57Z,
"@Vichu2005g the point is we want all of this propaganda to explode when the USA and Canada host the WC next time. Oh shit this will never happen, and no one will notice because people are stupid and they are only aware of what they are to be aware of",2022-11-21T09:49:19Z,
"@SDSD doesn’t change the fact there is a very big and huge propaganda program against Qatar by the mainstream media. Open your eyes, you are trying to make a narrative. Why do you think all the mainstream media outlets are talking about the same thing in the same time? 

Are you so naive to think this is a coincidence? 

Don’t you think there are major media outlets or elites who are trying to push this agenda?",2022-11-21T09:47:46Z,
"@Khaled Meb I am tired of this ""USA bad"" stuff everywhere. Yes, USA is bad if that's your point, your point but it's irrelevant in this video as we are not talking about USA",2022-11-21T09:40:11Z,

"@gevon george yes, finally someone not biased, it's not the countries fault, they're playing the system, US, EU, etc... Capitalism is good, but it should have boundaries, exploitative schemes are worldwide, crypto scams, minimum wage, etc...

France rebuilt itself for free with African labour, UK had millions died from toxicities like the fog, or mining, or literal kids on the chimney, US with the Asian and African migrants building the railways etc, Japan and S.korea with the cancerous working culture that pushes people, young people to dark times (if you know what I mean I might get shadowbanned) or what's happening in Turkmenistan or China both exploiting people for free for coton, or clothing companies in Bangladesh, chocolate companies in Mali, these are far worse yet everyone having their fingers on a small country that's upcoming in the economic scale, Korea done worse, the west even more brutal, don't let me started on African diamonds, yet these things are still consumed and not enough coverage, were western media doing all this to Qatar mainly because of alcohol ban and the LGTV agenda.",2022-11-20T19:01:33Z,
